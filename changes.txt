This file documents the changes that were implemented with each new
release of the CCP1GUI.

The html version is mainted in doc/html/changes.html


Version 0.8 - release date: 28th May 2010

    * Removal of the reliance on Numeric/Scientific Python - wrappers
      have been written so that we can use either numpy or Numeric if
      they are available, and it is no longer a fatal error if neither
      of them are present (although certain functionality will not be
      available).
    * Tools have been added to change the lengths of bonds and to
      rotate fragments of molecules about a bond.
    * An interface to the iPython shell has been added, to allow an
      iPython shell to be opened from within the CCP1GUI.
    * Images can now be saved as TIFF files.
    * The molecular rendering code has been updated so that it is now
      possible to view all the different renderers separately;
      previously the sticks representation relied on the wireframe
      representation being present.
    * "Data summary" widgets have been added to the vector visualiser
      classes so that information on the numerical data being
      visualised can be seen.
    * The GAMESS-UK output reader now returns trajectory objects and
      vibration visualisers instead of just molecule objects.
    * A single instance of FileIO objects can now read in multiple
      files.
    * The CCP1GUI should now be started by the ccp1gui.py file in the
      main directory. This script checks for any import errors and
      displays information on what modules need to be installed for
      the CCP1GUI to function properly. This replaces the ccp1gui.sh
      file under unix and ccp1gui.bat file under Windows.
    * The unittesting framework has been updated and new tests
      added. There is now a testall.py script in the main directory
      that cycles through a number of these tests and provides a quick
      way to check that the basic functionality is working.
    * The documentation and project website have been updated.
    * Additional examples have been added to the examples directory to
      increase unittesting coverage.
    * The molecular picking code has been updated so that it is now
      possible to select atoms in the sphere representation without
      the wireframe representation being present.
    * Added the option to edit a grid that has been read in.
    * Added menu option to get bond length and angle listing
    * Save as now supports .res format.
    * Load from file can now load GAMESS-UK output format.
    * Improved handling of GAMESS-UK restarts (including a better
      choice for directory defaults)
    * Molecular editing now includes addition of fragments (a
      selection of R groups and pi-bound ligands is added)
    * Bug 2992807 with the "add fragment" tool has been fixed.
    * Bug 2292810 with the MNDO calculation editor has ben fixed.


Version 0.7 - release date: 11th May 2004

    * Errors when generating output files are displayed in Tk dialog
      boxes.
    * Imporoved Geometry optimisation and DFT options for GAMESS-UK.
    * Individual help files for each of the GAMESS-UK tabs.
    * Calculation objects and basis managers can now be pickled.
    * Removed the 'Copy Calculation' option.
    * Added option to select for symmetry in a GAMESS-UK calculation.
    * Added options to calculate HOMO/LUMOs 3-5 for GAMESS-UK.
    * Basis manager now updates when the molecule is edited in the
      main window.
    * Tool to calculate and display non-bonded contacts.
    * Molecules can now be deleted.
    * Added a 'select by bonds' option to select all of a molecular
      fragment.
    * Delete option for both selected and unselected atoms.
    * Scale and tolerance for bonds and non-bonded contacts can be set
      in options panel now.
    * Implemented basic restart functionality for GAMESS-UK calculations.
    * sv 6-31G, cc-pvdz, cc-pvtz, cc-pvqz and cc-pv5z basis sets added
      for GAMESS-UK.
    * Hybridise tool now made more reliable.
    * 'Write Input' method added for Mopac calculations.
    * Right-clicking in the Grid Editor now brings up a menu to output
      different formats of the grids.
    * Enabled error trapping of stderr for some calculations so that
      the errors can be reported in dialog widgets.


Version 0.6 - release date: 19th March 2004

    * Many minor enhancements and bug fixes.
    * Load up GAMESS-UK internal basis set information.
    * Change handling of atom selection in Z-matrix editor.
    * Z-matrix editor now has a close button.
    * Fix autoz anomaly for CX4 molecules.
    * Z-matrix reader now works from main menu.
    * Removed bulky examples (download data directory).
    * Built complete Suse, RedHat and Windows downloadable
    * distributions.
    * Enabled output of DFT options from GAMESS-UK.
    * Fixes to CML reader (# atoms, atom ordering).
    * CML(1) and MSI output routines.
    * Simple animation tool.
    * Reader for Gaussian format z-matrices.


Version 0.5 - release date: 3rd March 2004

    * Added links to idle shell and pydoc, F1 help
    * Ballon help on main window
    * Reorganised views menus
    * new modules to figure out pathnames
    * Many changes relating to use of ChemShell on windows
    * Update of module documentation
    * Correction to lanl2dz sample ecp basis file


Version 0.4 - release date: 10th Feb 2003

    * Reorganisation of directories.
    * Significant reorganisation of calculation editor codes (tools.py
    * etc).
    * BasisManager and associated classes added.
    * Introduced cut slice visualiser, grid editors, 2D window etc.
    * doc/html directory added.


Version 0.3 - release date: 11th June 2003

    * fix paste of atoms with variable references.
    * add angstroms key to output zmatrix.
    * Initial implementation of VTK graphics back end.
