This is the CCP1GUI: a free, extensible Graphical User Interface to
various computational chemistry codes developed by the worldwide
academic community, with an emphasis on ab initio Quantum Chemistry
codes. The CCP1GUI is still at the prototype stage, but is certainly
usable for running and visualising simple calculations with GAMESS-UK,
ChemShell and Dalton.

For more information on the CCP1GUI, please visit the GUI's homepage
at:

	http://www.cse.clrc.ac.uk/qcg/ccp1gui/index.shtml

The CCP1GUI is hosted on Sourceforge, and you can access the project's
homepage on Sourceforge at:

	 http://sourceforge.net/projects/ccp1gui/

This folder contains the Python sourcecode for the CCP1GUI. In order
to run the CCP1GUI, you will be required to have Python installed on
your computer. Python is available from:


     http://www.python.org/

Currently, the CCP1GUI also has some external depenancies, so that
there are a few additional packages that you will need to install in
order to run the CCP1GUI. These packages are:

Tcl/TK
	http://tcl.sourceforge.net/

Tkinter
	http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter

The Visualisation Toolkit (VTK)
    http://public.kitware.com/VTK/

Numerical Python
	  http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy

Scientific Python
	   http://starship.python.net/~hinsen/ScientificPython/

Python Mega Widgets (Pmw)
       http://pmw.sourceforge.net/

These are all freely available, and often available as RPM packages
for Linux machines. There are detailed instructions on how to install
these packages on the CCP1GUI website at:

      http://www.cse.clrc.ac.uk/qcg/ccp1gui/install.shtml


Once you have these packages installed, you should be able to run the
CCP1GUI on Unix/Linux/MacOSX machines, by executing the ccp1gui.sh
script in this directory as shown below:

./ccp1gui.sh

or by double-clicking on the ccp1gui.bat file (also in this directory)
under Windows.

If you have any problems or queries relating to the CCP1GUI, please
send an email to either of:

Jens Thomas: j.m.h.thomas@dl.ac.uk

Paul Sherwood: p.sherwood@dl.ac.uk


We hope you enjoy using the CCP1GUI!
