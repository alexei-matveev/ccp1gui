Calc Menu
=========

Save...

    * Save the currently selected options to a .clc file so that the
      editing of the calculation can be postponed to a later time.

Run
    * Run a GAMESS-UK calculation with the currently selected options.

Copy

    * This copies the variables for the current calculation and opens
      a fresh calculation window so that a new calculation can be set
      up using the currently selected values as a basis (NOT ACTIVE AT
      THE MOMENT).

Write Inputfile

    * Write a GAMESS-UK input file in the directory specified in the
      Working Directory tool in the job tab. If no directory is
      specified, the directory from which the CCP1GUI was started is
      used. The output file will be saved with same name as the
      molecule being edited, but with the suffix .in appended.

Run Inputfile

    * Run a GAMESS-UK calculation using the input file that was
      written with the Write Inputfile option.

Close

    * Close the GAMESS-UK calculation window. Any unsaved changes will
      be lost.

Edit Menu

Input

    * Open the Inputfile that was written with the File -> Write
      Inputfile in a simple text-editor window. Clicking Ok in the
      editor window saves the results of the edit to file and Cancel
      discards them.

View Menu

Input

    * View the GAMESS-UK input file.

Output

    * View the GAMESS-UK output file for the current calculation.

Results Summary

    * View a summary of the results of the GAMESS-UK calculation as
      extracted from the output file. The results will be displayed in
      the Python terminal from which the CCP1Gui was run.

Molecule Tab
============

The options in this tab set up some of the most basic and general
options for the calculation.

Options Group
-------------

This group sets the basic options for the calculation.

    * Title - a title for the calculation can be entered here. This
      will be displayed at the head of the GAMESS-UK output file.

    * Task - this can be used to select the type of GAMESS-UK
      calculation that will be undertaken.

          o Energy - this undertakes a single-point integrals and SCF
          calculation and corresponds to the GAMESS-UK runtype scf
          option.

          o Gradient This forces the computation of both the energy and the forces.
          o Geometry Optimisation - this optimises the geometry of the
          molecule by searching for a local minimum on the potential
          energy surface. Additional optimisation options can be set
          in the Optimisation tab.

    * Charge - specify the overall charge on the molecule.

    * SpinSpecify the spin multiplicity of the molecule.

    * Check Spin - this just checks the spin multiplicity of the
      molecule is consistent with the number of electrons in the
      molecule.

Basis Selector Group
--------------------

The tools in this group are used to select which basis sets are
applied to which atoms in the molecule. The currently applied basis
set is shown in the Current Basis Assignment window.

    * Default Basis - this is used to select the basis set that is
      applied to all the atoms, unless other basis sets are
      specifically applied using the Assign by atom tool. The default
      basis set for GAMESS-UK is the 3-21G split valence basis set.

    * Assign by Atom - the tools in this group are used to apply
      specific basis sets to atoms within a molecule.

          o Clicking on the Assign Type button will apply the basis
          set shown in the Choose Basis selector to the specified
          atom. Any changes made in the Default Basis tool will now no
          longer apply to this atom unless it is selected again and
          the Clear Assignment button is pressed.

          o If the basis set that you require is not available from
          the menus, you can write or past the basis set specification
          into the Custom Basis Specification window.
