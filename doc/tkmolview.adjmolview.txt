    Adjust Molecule View
   
    The adjust molecule view tool changes the way that the molecular structure
    is displayed on the screen. The tool is displayed below:
   
    The available options are:
   
      + Wireframe - lines are drawn connecting the individual atoms. From their
        midpoint to the end connected to an atom, the lines are coloured with
        the colour associated with that atom type.
      + Spheres - the 'balls' of the conventional 'ball and stick'
        representation of molecules. Spheres are drawn centered on the
        individual atoms, sized and coloured according to the atom type that
        they are associated with.
      + Sphere Scale - this determines the relative sizes of the spheres.
      + Sticks - the 'sticks' of the conventional 'ball and stick'
        representation of molecules. Grey cylinders are drawn connecting
        individual atoms.
      + Labels - this displays labels identifiying the individual atoms. The
        labels show the type of the atom, as well as a unique number
        identifying each atom.
      + Label Size - the font size used for the labels.
      + Contacts - this shows non-bonded contacts between different atoms as
        white lines drawn between the two atoms. The criteria for determining
        non-bonded contacts can be adjusted in the Edit Options window.
