Basic Windows install

1) Install the following

    Python 2.1
    Pmw
        http://pmw.sourceforge.net/doc/starting.html
    Numeric Python
        http://www.pfdubois.com/numpy/

    Scientific Python
       http://starship.python.net/~hinsen/ScientificPython/
       Installed ScientificPython-2.4.3.tar.gz by extracting to a local directory
       run setup.py install
        - John ran setup.py build & copied the Scientific directory under
        build/lib to Lib/site-packages in the Python21 installation directory
    Pythonwin
       http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/win32/Downloads.html
    PyXML (needed for CML processing)
       http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/topics/download.html
    VTK
        You can use the distribution from Kitware, installed in the default
        location of c:\Progam Files\vtk42

2) Unpack the python_dev directory into c:\python_dev

3) you can use the "Properties" item on the Taskbar menu to add ccp1gui.bat
   to your start menu

   The program should run without any further changes

For Python 2.2

    VTK (Les Schaffer DLLs)
      unpack core (non-python) DLLs somewhere convenient (e.g. c:\vtk4)
      PATH - to include this directory  c:\vtk4 

      move contents of ...\site-packages\ to c:\Python22\Lib\site-packages

      PYTHON_PATH should be OK in this case 
          ?? maybe should point to core DLLS

   If not installing in site-packages
      PYTHON_PATH should include both VTK and core DLLs

Notes..
  John had to remove python and tcl/tk from the cygwin installation.
