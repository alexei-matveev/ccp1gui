The Shell menu is used to open an IDLE (Integrated Development
Environment) Python shell - assuming you have IDLE installed. IDLE is
included with most Python distributions, but if for any reason you
don't have it, it is availalable from: http://www.python.org/idle

When opened from within the GUI, IDLE provides a powerful tool with
which to interact with the GUI. The GUI Python objects can be operated
on directly and information about them displayed.

It is also possible to write and run scripts to carry out complex
operations.

More help on this is to follow.

MAJOR BUG ... on Windows, you should not open this window if you
intent to use the codes on the Compute Menu, the whole GUI will
hang when the slave programs are started.
