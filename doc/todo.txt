                    To Do List
                    ==========

1. Calculation and Calculation Editor Objects
   ===========================================
   Re-enable pickling of calc objects (seems OK now)

   reinstate selector to switch molecule

  Use of rlock to lock GUI elements - is this needed?

1.1 GAMESS-UK
    dumpfile&restart options
    dft quad grids, charge fitting
      still need to be enabled
    queue vs submit
    pathname configuration or variable + document
    Error: dialog for Current Spin OK

   Error handler in gamess-uk run is poor
     things we could check for...
     zmatrix has no variables
     X atoms remain 
     spin multiplicity problems

   - Why is symmetry and symmetry adaption off?
     could we deal with orientation changes?

   - check storage of dumpfile and restart

   - add atomic charges (mulliken, pdc, dma etc), ideally
     using some atom dictionary which will map to xml structures.

   harmonic switch

   working directory .. we could put something useful in there.

   packing/alignment of widgets

cc-pvdz etc
  check opengl renderer again
  check load up of xml
  introduce some molden file format?
  reader for orth?
 - restore pymol-based functionality
 - try vtk build on windows from CVS
 - make sure openGL code works well enough to use in case VTK fails
 - grid interface .. coupling to loki, HPCx, etc
 - <a href="dummy.txt">GUI TODO List</a>
nice table of bond lengths angles and torsions.
take close-and-save button off the cut slice widget
change buttons on the properties and extend widgets
guess tools dont initialise properly from
   the data held in the calculation structure
Add PDC code


   also bad that symmetry is activated by default
   adapt is switched independently of symmetry (in chemshell case, but 
      not gamess interface)
   sort out a way of detecting chemshell errors (even
      minimal example of deleting the punchfile)
      .. or better a way to catch the return code
   problems arising from having selected atoms showing when 
      a new geom is read in.
   dl_poly interface should support bypass_parameterisation and save_dl_poly_files

   - would be much better if output file was loaded for good or bad 
     (then could examine problems,.... not see previous output)

1.2 ChemShell
    GAMESS-UK relies on rungamess, some workaround in ChemShell is needed
    under windows (this is now OK with cygwin GAMESS-UK)

    No gulp stuff in any of them yet

    connectivity handling for MM calcs seems wrong, I think there is
    a reconnect going on in chemshell

    clearly some code missing for the case that create_mm_calc fails

    when chemshell script is not in path current version carries on
    even after a msg on stderr


1.3 Mopac
=========

    some structures dont transfer properly via cartesian coord input.

2. Z-Matrix Editor
==================

   Update when main window changes
   Autoz algorithm needs to 
      a) keep as much of existing zmatrix as possible
      b) work for non-fully-connected systems

    still sometimes hang in autoz
       - fix algorithm or make a subthread?
       - fix issue with AX4 molecules as well

 * It would be useful if there were some more keyboard bindings
    - Arrow keys up and down to move up and down the list
    - Enter key to move down the list after updating the zmatrix
    - Tab key works as expected
    - bind the del key in the graphics window to delete the selected atom
    - There should be an undo function.

   - When editing the atom coordinates, it would be useful if
   selecting a field automatically selected the contents.  I've just
   dfound double clicking does that!

   - I'm seeing strange behaviour for z/phi.  Using phi the list box
   shows values of 0.0000 but when I select the edit box show -
   9.68339008.  Only values of 0.0 seem to be affected values of 180
   seem OK.  Found when building benzene with sp2

   - occasionally on building I get a sudden change in the bonding.

   - remove unused variables at output, from menu

   Provide a quit menu item and warning
   How to save z-matrix for the next session (perhaps best
   incorporated into the calculation object)

    1. Even though it is reasonably obvious, it might make things
    clearer to have an intial column in the table that states whether
    the line is being displayed in Z-matrix or cartesian form.

    2. The white canvas where the coordinates are displayed is too
    long - it should only extend down to just below where the text
    finishes.

    3. There should be a 'close' button or at least an option under
    the file menu to close the Coords window.

   4. There should be an 'update' button below the single-line
   editable field that updates both the coordinate window and the
   image (an alternative to binding enter)

   check and ask "save changes to atom....."

   6. When atoms are deleted the yellow 'select' dots remain on the
   screen (Check this out)

   copy/paste with variables
   fix connectivity errors on cut/paste

   when autoz is run.... 


3.  Job manager
  ==============
    Support running an update proc when files change

    Globus interface
    In some cases stderr is hard to find (e.g. BackgroundJob for chemshell)

    this should have two buttons - one to kill the
    calculation and another to dismiss the job manager icon.

    stdin/stdout for job steps .. problem under unix?


4. TkMolView program
=======================
   picking-based selection based for OpenGL backend

   allow selection on object views other than wireframe
   provide tools to output the structure
   finish linking in fragments
   update zme when edits are done in the main window
   fix/report VTK problem with single atoms not showing up
   provide some kind of a selection tool
BUG when zoomed right in picking doesnt work
BUG Fix Open Calc menu entry
BUG vis object names

   sort out Watch procedure (check unix and windows)

   ON EXIT Keep getting an error message saying memory can't be read.
   Exiting works OK when using the X button on the top right of the box.

   need an update after some key bindings (e.g. r)
   we need a z-rotation binding

   FILE MENU . Should think about binding standard key combinations to commands
   (e.g. Crtl-O for 'Open', Ctrl-N for 'New').

   Should re-instate the idea of playing a sequence of views
   ... this was really useful for the Cardiff Demo.

   Implement a 'valency check' button as similar programs have to make
   sure that what's drawn on the screen is viable.

   CALCULATIONS - Confusion around zmatrix files, input files and coordinates.

   problem with zero-length bonds and cylinder code

   editing .. found switching to sp3 when 3 atoms already present gave one new
   atom overlapping one of the others

Attempting to save gave an error
================================================================================
Exception in Tkinter callback
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "c:\PythonNest\Python21\lib\lib-tk\Tkinter.py", line 1285, in __call__
    return apply(self.func, args)
  File "c:\cygwin\home\john\python_dev\tkmolview\main.py", line 1565, in save_to
_file
    calcdir = re.sub(r"[^\/\\:]*$","",self.filename)
AttributeError: VtkGraph instance has no attribute 'filename'
=================================================================================

some more output formats
  - punchfile zmatrix might be helpful
  - PDB
  - CML?

how to use browser widget more sensibly
   - can it replace the extension when you pick an alternate file type?

   File -> New Molecule
     1. When selecting 'New Molecule' a dialogue box should pop up
     prompting for a name for the molecule and defaulting to New 1, New 2,
     ... etc if none is specified.

     2. When a new molecule is selected, the Tool Panel always
        appears slightly obscuring the screen and needs to be moved -
        if possible it should appear further down the screen.

     3. (optional) auto resize when reading in new molecules


4.1   VTK stuff
   Configurable VTK molecule views

   When "Save Image' is clicked, a menu should pop up so the user can
   select a filename, location and image format. The default name for
   the image should be the molecule name.

  Major problems with font size, justification etc when using
   vtkScaledTextActor etc in the 2D plane
   maybe report problems on VTK list?


5. Visualisers
================

HVD In animations it would be good to be able to change the
    view settings for all frames in one go.

   Isosurf code:
    also need to be able to rebuild the vtk points if the
    grid being visualised has changed?
    ? need to hold a variable to detect this?
    ? or could we look at dates held within VTK objects?

  vibration vis:
  add active_atoms for partial frequencies

   molecule vis:
   Shouldn't 'Sticks' and 'Wireframe' views be mutually exclusive?

   There should be an option to select the width of the sticks as they
   can be rather wide.

   The text and pointers don't line up

6. Basis 
   ======
   Build up internal library
   Add in proper keyword capability
   Access to PNNL over Web
   basis tool should be able to generate orbital stats for current basis


7. Selection Module and tools
=============================

BUG operations which delete/move atoms can leave stray yellow dots

Edit/Select all
- I expected to select all, but I had to select an atom, then it selects all but that atom
- I was wondering if it could select all atoms and the refresh the screen
- May be there should be different selection modes rather than just adding to the
  selection (replace)

BUG
  use select all when image isn't showing, produces yellow
  dots that dont go away properly 

Grid Editor
============

Sometimes the grid transformation goes haywire .. some loop taking
values way out of range, with no way back (cancel/restore has no effect,
seems the reference grid is being overwritten so each transform
is cumulative.

Also have observed that on linux, moving focus over some of the 
elements causes invocation of callbacks.

maybe set a minimum scale factor
hide z widgets when grid is 2d
have 1,2,3D selector
add file menu with read/write functions


Overall package
=====================

Propagate licences, copyright etc 

Make acknowledgements somewhere

Location of binaries?
     hardwired to subdirectories
     or rely on using paths
     configurable

   Layout of windows on the screen

   It's got a naff name - it really should have something more inspiring
   as it will help people to remember what it is.

    It might be a good idea to have a 'Close Panel' button on any
    new panel that pops up to make it easier to close.

   Determine exactly what modules/functionalities from the different
   packages (e.g. VTK) are required and package them together into a
   single Linux rpm or windows .exe package.

   A set of detailed instructions/helpfiles needs to be written and
   made available on the web and also included with the package. The
   'internal' help menus in the program need to be improved too,
   including things like binding context-sensitive help to the F1 key.

   Decide on filename extensions (ideally 3 character ones) avoiding
   clashes that might affect mailers etc.

   Find how to associate GUI with particular file types under windows
   and maybe a linux desktop.

   Need to make settings from options panel persistent and define
   a .ccp1guirc format


Handling of periodic edits
==========================

whether to write out the periodic structure (primitive cell)
or the current atom list.

this might depend on whether any any changes have been made,
? perhaps an edit should remove the cell vectors

currently we only output the full list - this is logical in a wysiwyg sense

only special case is where no modifications have been made 
    so cell is still present

we could extend view in visualiser instead of creating new atoms? (option of using a 
visibly different representation)

extensibility to other codes
=============================
the choice of job types is a bit confusing, some incomplete implementations
how to avoid chuncks of code being replicated for all QM codes
standardisation of parameter table
  how wide? include semi-empirical ? plane wave ?

major confusion of names and titles .. 

Clean code has no undo

better handling of user directory path (probably through paths module)
would be better.
