		              Welcome to the CCP1GUI!
			      =======================

This is the CCP1 Graphical User Interface from Daresbury Laboratory's
Quantum Chemistry Group.

Below is a description of the different menus that are available from
the main screen. Further help can be found be pressing F1 in an open
window, within the 'Help' menu on the far right of the main screen or
on the web at:

       http://www.cse.clrc.ac.uk/qcg/ccp1gui/index.shtml.

There should also be a collection of html helpfiles in the
python_dev/doc/html folder within the main CCP1GUI distribution
folder.

Various example molecules can be found in the 'data' and
python_dev/examples folders, and can be accessed by selecting File ->
Open and then browsing to these folders.

Viewing Molecules

It is possible to view the same molecule in a variety of different ways. The
Gui does this by creating different 'view objects', which are different
graphical representations of the same molecule.

View objects are grouped together under the View Menu according to the molecule
to which they belong. Selecting a particular molecule from the View Menu opens
a drop-down menu that lists the available views for that molecule and the
operations that can be carried out on that view. The operations are:

Show/Hide Molecule View

  * This is used to show or hide a particular view of a molecule.

Adjust Molecule View

  * This is where the properties of a particular view can be changed. For
    information on the Adjust Molecule View window that appears when this
    option is selected, click here or press F1 when the window is displayed.

New Molecule View

  * This creates a new view object for the molecule. The view can then be
    adjusted by selecting the view from the menu and selecting 'Adjust Molecule
    View' as above.

Viewing the results of calculations

When a calculation is carried out on a molecule, the result often includes the
value of a certain molecular property (the electrostatic potential or value of
the HOMO wavefunction, for example) at a particular point in space. These types
of property can be represented by a grid of points, the associated value of
each point being proportional to the magnitude of the property at that point.

Other properties can include the vibrational modes for a molecule, which can be
represented by their normal coordinates.

The GUI is equipped with visualisers that can be used to view both types of
properties. For grid-based properties, the GUI can create contour maps or
surfaces based on the grid, and for vibrational modes the GUI can animiate the
individual modes. The individual visualisers are highly configurable. The
following menu items list the visualisers and which of their properties can be
adjusted together with an explanation of what this means.

Irregular View

  * This is the closest view to the 'raw' data and consists of a grid of points
    with their associated values. The size of the points on the screen can be
    altered as can their opacity and the colour mapping.

Density View

  * This defines a single isosurface for a specified positive value of the
    grid. The contour height is adjustable, as is the colour and opacity.

Orbital View

  * This is similar to density view, except that a pair of isosurfaces are
    drawn, one for a specified positive value and another for the corresponding
    negative value.

Coloured Isosurface

  * The coloured isosurface representation creates an isosurface at a specified
    contour height. This surface can then be coloured according to the value of
    one of the other properties at points on this surface.

An explanation of the individual view properties:

  * Edit Colours - for surfaces that only have a single colour mapped to them,
    clicking on this option brings up the below dialog box that can be used to
    select the colour. The colour can be selected either by dragging the
    sliders to mix in various Red Green and Blue components, or the hexadecimal
    value of the colour can be entered in the selection box.

  * Colour Mapping - this lists the upper and lower values of the grid that the
    colour spectrum will be mapped to. The colour spectrum extends from blue to
    red, so any point whose value is less than the value specified in Lo will
    be coloured blue and any point whose value is greater than Hi will be
    coloured red. Points whose value falls in between Lo and Hi will be
    assigned a colour on the spectrum between blue and red, the exact colour
    depending on where their value falls between the Lo and Hi values.

      + Opacity - this determines how see-through the coloured surface will be.
      + Contour Height - this is the point value that the surface or contour
        will be mapped to; this effectively creates an isosurface mapped to the
        value specified in the contour height box.
      + Colour Field - this applies to the coloured isosurface tool, and
        colours the isosurface according to the property specified here. For
        example, an isosurface of the electron density can be displayed and
        this can be then coloured according to the electrostatic potential.
   
    Cut Slice View
   
      + The cut slice view creates a 2-dimensional 'canvas' that can be moved
        through the molecule, with the values of the function at the point the
        slice is taken displayed on the canvas as contours or a colourmap. The
        size, orientation and position of the slice can be specified by using
        the Tran, Rot and Scale tools, which alter the position, orientation
        and size respectively, of the grid components. The density of points,
        or mesh, that the colour map or contours are mapped along any
        particular axis can be specified with the nx, ny and nz tools.
       
        The options in the representations box determine which of the
        properties area shown. If contours is selected, contours are displayed.
        The maximum and minimum contour values, as well as the total number of
        contours displayed can be specified with the Min Contour Height,Max
        Contour Height and Number of Contour tools. If Colourmap is selected a 
        colour map will be mapped on to the canvas as specified in the colour
        mapping tool.
       
        The border around the slice can be toggled on and off with the border
        tool.
       
        An optional 2D-representation of the canvas can also be created in a
        separate window by selecting the 2D Representation. Selecting this
        option opens up a separate window displaying a front-view of the
        canvas, which can be saved to the current directory as the file 
        out2d.jpeg.
       
    Vibrations
   
    If the one of the Frequencies options (finite difference or analytic) have
    been selected from the Properties Tab in the GAMESS-UK widget, then the
    vibrational frequencies of the molecule will be calculated, and the
    individual frequencies listed under the Views menu. To view a vibration,
    select the vibration from the views menu and a dialog box will be displayed.
   
    The first few tools are the same as those for the Adjust Molecule View Tool
    . The additional vibration-specific tools are contained in the Animation
    box. These are:
   
      + Start - animate the selected vibration.
      + Stop - stop the animation.
      + Number of Frames - this is the number of still images that will be
        concatenated to create the animation.
      + Amplitude - this determines the size of the vibration: the distance
        from the equilibrium point of the vibration to its apex.
      + Frame Delay - the time-step between each frame that is concatenated to
        create the animation.
   
    Animation...
   
      + The animation tool brings up a set of controls that can be used to
        display a movie by cycling through the sequence of images that have
        been loaded into the CCP1GUI. There are buttons to 'play' the sequence
        in a loop, go to the first or last frame, or move forward or backwards
        a frame at a time.
      
      + The animation tool is particularly useful if you have carried out a
        geometry optimisation under GAMESS-UK, as the geometry of the molecule
        at each stage of the optimisation is saved to the punch file. Using the
        animation tools, a movie showing the progression of the geometry
        optimisation can be displayed.
   
    Show/Hide All
   
      + Show All and Hide All affect the visibility of all graphical
        representations.
   
    Centre on Selected
   
      + Changes the origin for viewing and rotations of the centroid of the
        selected atoms.

      + The compute menu is used to select a program with which to run a
        calculation on the molecule. Currently, the GUI has control interfaces
        for GAMESS-UK, Mopac and Chemshell. For help relating to the control
        window for a particular program, press F1 when the window is
        displayed.

      + The Shell menu is used to open an IDLE (Integrated Development
        Environment) Python shell - assuming you have IDLE installed. IDLE is
        included with most Python distributions, but if for any reason you
        don't have it, it is available from: http://www.python.org/idle
      + When opened from within the GUI, IDLE provides a powerful tool with
        which to interact with the GUI. The GUI Python objects can be operated
        on directly and information about them displayed.
      + It is also possible to write and run scripts to carry out complex
        operations.
      + More help on this is to follow.
