Edit Grid

When a particular analysis option is selected, the GAMESS-UK
calculation will output a grid of points where the selected molecular
property has been calculated at each point. The Edit Grid button
brings up a separate window which can be used to tune the properties
of the Grid. The options available for the grid are:

    * X Tran - the slider can be used to shift the origin of the
      grid's x-axis. Alternatively the shift can be specified in
      Angstroms and entered in the box to the right of the slider.

    * Y Tran - as for X Tran, but applies to the y-axis.

    * Z Tran - as for X Tran, but applies to the z-axis.

    * X Rot - the slider can be used to rotate the grid about the
      x-axis. Alternatively the angle of rotation can be entered in
      the box to the right of the slider.

    * Y Rot - as for X Rot, but applies to the y-axis.

    * Z Rot - as for X Rot, but applies to the z-axis.

    * X Scale - the slider can be used to scale the length of the
      x-axis, or the relative value can be entered in the box to the
      right.

    * Y Scale - as for X Scale, but applies to the y-axis.

    * Z Scale - as for X Scale, but applies to the z-axis.

    * nx - this counter is used to specify the 'mesh density' along
      the x-axis. For rectangular grids, this is the total number of
      points along the axis.

    * ny - as for nx, but applies to the y-axis.

    * nz - as for nx, but applies to the z-axis.

    * Transform - apply any changes that are pending.

    * Close and Save - close the Grid Editor window and return to the
      calculation window, saving any changes that have been made.

    * Reset - reset the grid to its default values.

    * Close and Cancel - close the Grid Editor window and return to
      the calculation window, but discard any changes that have been
      made.
