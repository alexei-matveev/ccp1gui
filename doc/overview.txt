0. Introduction


1. Directory Structure

ccp1gui

  The core GUI code 
  - the Zmatrix and Atom classes 
  - QM and MM code interface objects
  - Tk editors for the code parameters and zmatrix objects
  - Field class, and GridEditor class (includes FPScale widget)

chempy

   Slightly modified copy of the implementation of 
   chemical objedts from PyMOL.
   We use the Indexed, Atom and Bond classes.

examples

    Some molecules to read in

tests
 
    small python fragments exploring various issues that
    crop up in development (not really interesting to the
    non-developer)

graph

    base Graph and Visualiser classes

pymolgraph

    Derived Graph and Visualiser classes when using PyMOL is
    as the visualisation engine (needs work to get this working
    again.

tkmolview

    A small, stand-alone python molecular viewer and editor based
    on either VTK or OpenGL graphics.
    Includes code for selection, periodic table class and widget

jobmanager

    Classes to support the execution of local and remote calculations,
    includes a Tk job editor widget to view job status and kill jobs as
    required.

basis

    Classes to manage Gaussian basis sets, including some data files

doc 

    Preliminary documentation files (text format)
    
2. Other documentation

The code is documented and developers should find something useful
by running pydoc, in practice this doesn't work well although some
module documentation can be viewed.

Other files in this directory

3. User Documentation

For now, see the help screens of the GUI.
