   Autoz - generate an automatic (new) zmatrix 
     Requires all atoms to be connected

   Convert Selection to zmatrix/cartesian
     - interchanges the type of definition. 
     when switching to z-matrix the program will use any internal coordinates
     that have been defined, if not, i1,i2,i3,r,theta,phi fields will all have
     default values and will need to be filled in.
