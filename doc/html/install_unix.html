<h1 align=center>Installation of the packages for the CCP1GUI under
Unix/Linux</h1>

<h2>Base Packages</h2>

<p>The majority of these should be available under the package
management system under Linux systems (e.g. yast with Suse, apt-get
with <a href="#apt-get">Debian or Ubuntu</a>, yum under Redhat or
emerge under Gentoo) or on the installation cd's for your
distribution. Even if they are not, then you may be able to find rpm
distributions of the relevant packages ( if you are running Redhat,
Suse or their ilk ).</p>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with Unix/Linux command-line tools and how to
determine which rpms are installed / how to add new packages, there
are some instructions on how to use these in the <a
href="./linuxhelp.html">Linux Help</a> section.

<p>A good place to start looking for rpm packages is the <a
href="http://www.rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/">rpmfind</a> site.</p>

<a name="python"></a><h3>Python</h3>

<p>There are a range of different python distributions in use:
Python 1.5, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4. The CCP1GUI should work quite happily
with most of these, although you are recommended to try and get the
most up-to-date possible.</p>

<p>If Python isn't installed on your system, it is available from: <a
href="http://www.python.org/download/">www.python.org/download/</a></p>

<a name="tcltk"></a><h3>Tcl/Tk</h3>
<p>A good place to look for Tcl/Tk packages is the <a
href="http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/">Tcl Developer Xchange</a>, or
you can always get it  as source from the <a
href="http://tcl.sourceforge.net/">Tcl/Tk</a> pages on Sourceforge, by
clicking on the <b>File Distribution</b> link.</p>

<a name="tkinter"></a><h3>Tkinter</h3>

<p>Tkinter is really considered to be part of Python and so is usually
included with most Python distributions (and comes if you download
Python as source code). Unfortunately, many Linux
distributions do not install Tkinter by default, even though it is
provided, so you will need to look for the appropriate rpm on the
installation cds or via the package manager. Additional information on
Tkinter can be found at: <a
href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter">http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter</a>.</p>

<p>With the three above packages installed, you should be in a
position to download a bundle for your system. If one is not
available, then please read on for instructions on how to install the
additional packages.</p>

<h2 align="center">Additional Packages</h2>

<a name="numeric"></a><h3>Numerical Python</h3>
<p>The Numerical Python website at <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1369&package_id=1351">sourceforge</a> has links
to tarred and gzipped archives that you can find by clicking
on the <b>Download Numerical Python</b> link. Then select the
<b>numpy</b> package to download and you will be presented with a page
that offers rpm packages as well as source distributions.</p>

<p>If you are using the source distribution, you will need to unpack
the distribution with the command:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>gunzip < Numeric-24.2.tar.gz | tar xvf -</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>To install the package, you will need to cd into the <b>Numeric-24.2</b> you 
have just unpacked and have root priviledges. Whilst sat in the
directory <b>Numeric-24.2</b> enter the command:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>python setup.py install</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This runs the setup.py Python script that copies the relevant files 
into the path of the Python version you are using to invoke the
script. If you want to install the python somewhere else, the you can
find more information on how to use setup.py scripts at the <a
href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/inst/">distutils</a> page
on the Python website.</p>

<a name="scientific"></a><h3>Scientific Python</h3>
<p>The Scientific Python website: <a
href="http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/plone/software/scientificpython/">http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/plone/software/scientificpython/</a>
has links to downloads for rpm files as well as source distributions.</p>
</p>

<p>If you are using the source distribution, you will need to unpack
the distribution with the command:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>gunzip < Scientific-2.4.9.tar.gz | tar xvf -</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>To install the package, you will need to cd into the <b>Scientific-2.4.9</b> you 
have just unpacked and have root priviledges. Whilst sat in the
directory <b>Scientific-2.4.9</b> enter the command:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>python setup.py install</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This runs the setup.py Python script that copies the relevant files 
into the path of the Python version you are using to invoke the
script. If you want to install the Python somewhere else, the you can
find more information on how to use setup.py scripts at the <a
href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/inst/">distutils</a> page
on the Python website.</p>

<a name="pmw"></a><h3>Pmw</h3>
<p>Pmw is just pure Python code, and so doesn't need to be installed
as such, just copied into a place where Python can find it. A link to
a download of a tarred and zipped archive is available on the Pmw <a
href="http://pmw.sourceforge.net/">webpage</a>.
You should be able to unpack the archive with the command:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>gunzip < Pmw.1.2.tar.gz | tar xvf -</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This will give you a folder called <b>Pmw</b> To install Pmw, copy this folder into the
<b>site-packages</b> folder of your python installation, as show below. This
command applies to Python 2.3 as installed in /usr/lib. Please
change the version number (2.3) and prefix to whatever is suitable for
your installation if it is different.</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>cp -R Pmw /usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages/</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<blockquote>
<p><b>NB:</b>If you aren't sure where you python site-packages is
located, you can find out by executing the following sequence of commands:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td><tt>python</tt></td></tr>
</table>

<p>This should start the python interpreter on your system and give
you a python prompt (something like <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;</b> should
appear). If that does, type:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td><tt>import sys</tt></td></tr>
</table>

<p>This imports the system module that we can then query to find the python
path with the command:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td><tt>print sys.path</tt></td></tr>
</table>

<p>This will print out the path that Python searches for Modules. Look
for the one that has <b>site-packages</b> in it.</p>
</blockquote>

<a name="vtk"></a><h3>VTK</h3>
<p>If you are fortunate then you may find that a vtk package already exists
for your distribution. This is certainly the case for <a href="#apt-get">Debian</a>, and if
are running Redhat 9.0, rpm distributions for are available from: <a 
href="http://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/vtk/">www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/vtk/</a></p>

<!-- 
<p>If you are running Redhat 7.1, then vtk rpms for this distribution are available from:</p>
<a
href="http://www.fysik.dtu.dk/CAMPOS/Download/CAMPOS_access.html">www.fysik.dtu.dk/CAMPOS/Download/CAMPOS_access.html</a>

<p>The packages you will need to download from this site are:</p>

<ul>
<li>vtk-<i>&lt;release_and_cvs_number&gt;</i>.i386.rpm</li>
<li>vtk-python-<i>&lt;release_and_cvs_number&gt;</i>.i386.rpm</li>
</ul>
-->

<p>If the above fails, then the following instructions are for
building VTK.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://public.kitware.com/VTK/">Visualization ToolKit</a> (VTK) is an open source, freely available
software system for 3D computer graphics, image processing, and
visualization that can be used for creating graphical representations
of molecules.</p>

<p> The following instructions are for building VTK from
source. To do this you will need  a C/C++-compiler. On Linux systems gcc will be there by
default, on Macs, you can user the developer tools or install <a
href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">fink</a> and use this to install
gcc. On Windows, your best bet is probably to install <a
href="http://www.cygwin.com/">cygwin</a> and get gcc that way.</p>

<p>With a compiler in place you will need to install 
the relevant development packages on your system ( development
packages contain the header files for C/C++ and other information
needed when you compile a package ). Assuming you already have Tk/Tcl,
Python and Tkinter installed as mentioned in the sections above, then you will just need to
install the development versions of these packges.</p>

<p>The next stage is to install cmake, the cross-platform make
utility. You can get this from the <a
href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake website</a>.</p>

<p>Next, download the lastest VTK release
from <a href="http://public.kitware.com/VTK/get-software.php">http://public.kitware.com/VTK/get-software.php</a>.
The file will extract to a directory called VTK. <kbd>cd</kbd> into
this directory and enter:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>ccmake</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This runs CMake with a curses interface, where it will ask you a
number of different questions. The first question you will be asked is
if you would like to see the advanced options - if you do you probably
don't need to be reading this. Most of the remaining options shouldn't need to
be changed and those that you may want to should be
self-explanatory. Options that you <i>must</i> select (i.e. set to <i>ON</i>), however are the
following:</p>

<ul>
<li>BUILD_SHARED_LIBS</li>
<li>VTK_USE_HYBRID</li> 
<li>VTK_WRAP_PYTHON</li>
<li>VTK_WRAP_TCL</li>
</ul>

<p>When CMake has finished, just type:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>make</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>in the VTK directory to build the VTK binaries, and then:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>make install</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

</p>to install vtk onto your system.</p>

<h2 align="center">The CCP1GUI under Debian/Ubuntu</h2>

<a name="apt-get"></a><h3>Using apt-get</h3>

<p>To install the CCP1GUI on a Debian or Ubuntu system, you will need to
install the following packages:</p>

<ul>
<li>python-numeric</li>
<li>python-scientific</li>
<li>python-pmw</li>
<li>python-vtk</li>
</ul>

<p>You can either use the synaptic package manager GUI to do this in
Ubuntu, (in which case all the packages are listed under the &quot;Python
Programming Language (Universe)&quot; section, or use the command:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>sudo apt-get install python-numeric python-scientific python-pmw python-vtk</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>from the command line in both Debian and Ubuntu.</p>
