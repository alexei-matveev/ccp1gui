<h1 align=center>Installation of the packages for the CCP1GUI under
Unix/Linux</h1>

<a name="SuSE"><h2>SuSE</h2>
<p>Under OpenSuse, the following rpm files will need to installed:</p>

<ul>
<li>python-tk</li>
<li>vtk-python</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, to access the full functionality of the CCP1GUI you should also install:</p>

<ul>
<li>python-numpy</li>
<li>python-scipy</li>
</ul>


<a name="Ubuntu"><h2>Ubuntu</h2>

<p>Under Ubuntu, the following packages need to installed:</p>

<ul>
<li>python-tk</li>
<li>python-vtk</li>
<li>python-pmw</li>
<li>python-numeric</li>
<li>python-numeric-ext</li>
</ul>

<p>These packages can be installed using apt-get or synaptic if the Universe repositories have been enabled. For advice on how to do this see:</p>

<h2 align="center">Manual installation of additional Packages</h2>

<p>You should only follow these instructions if you cannot get the packages via
  the package management system of your operating system.</p>

<a name="numeric"></a><h3>Numerical Python</h3>
<p>The Scientific
  Python <a href="http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/plone/software/scientificpython">website</a>
  has a download link for the recommended version of Numerical Python, together
  with instructions on how to install it.</p>

<a name="scientific"></a><h3>Scientific Python</h3>
The Scientific
  Python <a href="http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/plone/software/scientificpython">website</a>
  has a download link and installation instructions for Scientific Python.</p>

<a name="pmw"></a><h3>Pmw</h3>
<p>Pmw is just pure Python code, and so doesn't need to be installed
as such, just copied into a place where Python can find it. A link to
a download of a tarred and zipped archive is available on the Pmw <a
href="http://pmw.sourceforge.net/">webpage</a>.
You should be able to unpack the archive with the command:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>gunzip < Pmw.1.2.tar.gz | tar xvf -</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This will give you a folder called <b>Pmw</b> To install Pmw, copy this folder into the
<b>site-packages</b> folder of your python installation, as show below. This
command applies to Python 2.3 as installed in /usr/lib. Please
change the version number (2.3) and prefix to whatever is suitable for
your installation if it is different.</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>cp -R Pmw /usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages/</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<blockquote>
<p><b>NB:</b>If you aren't sure where you python site-packages is
located, you can find out by executing the following sequence of commands:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td><tt>python</tt></td></tr>
</table>

<p>This should start the python interpreter on your system and give
you a python prompt (something like <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;</b> should
appear). If that does, type:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td><tt>import sys</tt></td></tr>
</table>

<p>This imports the system module that we can then query to find the python
path with the command:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td><tt>print sys.path</tt></td></tr>
</table>

<p>This will print out the path that Python searches for Modules. Look
for the one that has <b>site-packages</b> in it.</p>
</blockquote>

<a name="vtk"></a><h3>VTK</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://public.kitware.com/VTK/">Visualization ToolKit</a> (VTK) is an open source, freely available
software system for 3D computer graphics, image processing, and
visualization that can be used for creating graphical representations
of molecules.</p>

<p> The following instructions are for building VTK from source.</p>

<p>With a compiler in place you will need to install 
the relevant development packages on your system ( development
packages contain the header files for C/C++ and other information
needed when you compile a package ). Assuming you already have Tk/Tcl,
Python and Tkinter installed as mentioned in the sections above, then you will just need to
install the development versions of these packges.</p>

<p>The next stage is to install cmake, the cross-platform make
utility. You can get this from the <a
href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake website</a>.</p>

<p>Next, download the lastest VTK release
from <a href="http://public.kitware.com/VTK/get-software.php">http://public.kitware.com/VTK/get-software.php</a>.
The file will extract to a directory called VTK. <kbd>cd</kbd> into
this directory and enter:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>ccmake</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This runs CMake with a curses interface, where it will ask you a
number of different questions. The first question you will be asked is
if you would like to see the advanced options - if you do you probably
don't need to be reading this. Most of the remaining options shouldn't need to
be changed and those that you may want to should be
self-explanatory. Options that you <i>must</i> select (i.e. set to <i>ON</i>), however are the
following:</p>

<ul>
<li>BUILD_SHARED_LIBS</li>
<li>VTK_USE_HYBRID</li> 
<li>VTK_WRAP_PYTHON</li>
<li>VTK_WRAP_TCL</li>
</ul>

<p>When CMake has finished, just type:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>make</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>in the VTK directory to build the VTK binaries, and then:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>make install</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

</p>to install vtk onto your system.</p>
