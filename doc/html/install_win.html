<h1 align=center>Installation of the software packages for the CCP1GUI
under Windows</h1>

<h2>Base Packages</h2>

<p>The easiest way to run the CCP1GUI under windows is to use the Python
  distribution
  from <a href="http://www.enthought.com/products/getepd.php">Enthought</a>. This
  is free to students and those in academic institutions.</p>

<p>This provides all the components needed by the CCP1GUI, so if you have this
  installed you can just download the latest version of the CCP1GUI
  from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ccp1gui/files/">sourceforge</a>, unzip it and then run it by double-clicking on the <b>ccp1gui.py</b> file.</p>

<p>If you do not wish to use Enthought, or it is not free for you, then Windows
  binaries for Python can be downloaded from
  the <a href="http://www.python.org/download/">Python website</a></p>

<p>Once you have Python installed, binaries of VTK, numpy, Scientific and Numeric python can be downloaded from
  those kindly made available on Christoph Gohlke's <a href="http:///www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/">website</a>.

<p>If using Christoph's binaries, extract the VTK zip file and then copy the
  folder in there called <b>vtk</b> into:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt><b>C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages</b></tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

</p>(or similar for the version of Python you are using). You will also need to add the full path to
the folder:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt><b>C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages\vtk</b></tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>to your <b>PATH</b> environment variable.</p>

<p>The packages for Numeric and/or Scientific are self-installing, so just
  double-click on the .exe file</p>

<p>You can now just download the latest version of the CCP1GUI
  from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ccp1gui/files/">sourceforge</a>,
  unzip it and then run it by double-clicking on the <b>ccp1gui.py</b>
  file.</p>


<p>Information on installing the additional packages individually follows below.</p>

<h2 align="center">Additional Packages</h2>

<a name="numeric"></a><h3>Numerical Python</h3>
<p>If you've installed the Enthought package as described above, you
already have Numeric installed. If you need to install it separately,
please vist the Numerical Python website at <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1369&package_id=1351">sourceforge</a> and click
on the <b>Download Numerical Python</b> link. Then select the
<b>numpy</b> package to download and you will be presented with a page
that offers both installers for windows as well as source builds.</p>


<a name="scientific"></a><h3>Scientific Python</h3>
<p>If you've installed the Enthought package as described above, you
already have Scientific Python installed. If you need to install it separately,
please vist the Scientific Python website at <a
href="http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/plone/software/scientificpython/">http://starship.python.net/~hinsen/ScientificPython/</a>.
The main page offers both installers for windows as well as downloads
of the Python source code.</p>

<a name="pmw"></a><h3>Python MegaWidgets</h3>
<p>Pmw is just pure Python code, and so doesn't need to be installed
as such, just copied into a place where Python can find it. A link to
a tarred and zipped archive is available on the Pmw <a
href="http://pmw.sourceforge.net/">webpage</a>.
You should be able to unpack the archive with a zip utility such as
Winzip, and it will unpack to create a folder called Pmw.</p>

<p>To install Pmw, copy this folder into the
<b>Python&lt;VERSION&gt;\Lib\site-packages</b> folder of your Python
installation. For example if you are using Python 2.3 and it is
installed on the default place on your C: drive, you would copy the
Pmw folder to:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt><b>C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages</b></tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<a name="vtk"></a><h3>VTK</h3>
<p>Binaries of VTK, numpy, Scientific and Numeric python can be downloaded from
  those kindly made available on Christoph Gohlke's <a href="http:///www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/">website</a>.

<p>If using Christoph's binaries, extract the VTK zip file and then copy the
  folder in there called <b>vtk</b> into:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt><b>C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages</b></tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

</p>(or similar for the version of Python you are using). You will also need to add the full path to
the folder:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt><b>C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages\vtk</b></tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>to your <b>PATH</b> environment variable.</p>
