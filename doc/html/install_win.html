<h1 align=center>Installation of the software packages for the CCP1GUI
under Windows</h1>

<h2>Base Packages</h2>

<p>The installation of the CCP1GUI on Windows has been made
considerably easier thanks to the nice people at <a
href="http://www.enthought.com">Enthought</a> who have
created a Python distribution that contains most of the software dependancies
required by the CCP1GUI.</p>

<p>Their Python installation program can be downloaded from:</p>

<a
href="http://www.enthought.com/python/">http://www.enthought.com/python/</a>

<p><b>IMPORTANT!:</b> Please make sure that you use the latest
(version 1.0.0 as of this writing) of Enthought Python, as versions
from 0.9.2 up until 1.0.0 did not include Tk and so did not work with the
CCP1GUI.</p>

<p>Save the installatation program to somewhere on your computer (e.g
your Desktop) and then run it by double-clicking on it.</p>

<p>It is important to let Enthought install the python in the default
location of C:\Python24 - otherwise you will need to edit the
ccp1gui.bat file to point it at your Python installation or set a
PYTHON environment variable to point at excutable.</p>

<p>When prompted to "Select Components" for the install "Python
interpreter and Libraries" as well as "Tcl/Tk (Tkinter, IDLE, pydoc)"
should be selected by default, but if for any reason they are not,
make sure that they are selected.</p>

<p>Once you have installed Python, you will need to reboot.</p>

<!--
<p>Next, install Mark Hammond's Python for Windows extensions from:</p>

<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/</a>

<p>You will need to ensure that you download the extensions for the
version of Python you downloaded from Enthought. For the latest
version of Enthought Python (2.3) you should download the file:</p>

<tt><b>pywin32-205.win32-py2.3.exe</b></tt>

<p>and then run it by double-clicking on it. The installer will ask you
where to install the extensions, and you should ensure that it has
selected the directory that holds your Enthought Python
installation.</p>

<p>At this point you have the base packages installed and so can
download a bundle, so only read on if you are installing the
additional packages individually.</p>

<h2 align="center">Additional Packages</h2>

<a name="numeric"></a><h3>Numerical Python</h3>
<p>If you've installed the Enthought package as described above, you
already have Numeric installed. If you need to install it separately,
please vist the Numerical Python website at <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1369&package_id=1351">sourceforge</a> and click
on the <b>Download Numerical Python</b> link. Then select the
<b>numpy</b> package to download and you will be presented with a page
that offers both installers for windows as well as source builds.</p>


<a name="scientific"></a><h3>Scientific Python</h3>
<p>If you've installed the Enthought package as described above, you
already have Scientific Python installed. If you need to install it separately,
please vist the Scientific Python website at <a
href="http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/plone/software/scientificpython/">http://starship.python.net/~hinsen/ScientificPython/</a>.
The main page offers both installers for windows as well as downloads
of the Python source code.</p>

<a name="pmw"></a><h3>Python MegaWidgets</h3>
<p>Pmw is just pure Python code, and so doesn't need to be installed
as such, just copied into a place where Python can find it. A link to
a tarred and zipped archive is available on the Pmw <a
href="http://pmw.sourceforge.net/">webpage</a>.
You should be able to unpack the archive with a zip utility such as
Winzip, and it will unpack to create a folder called Pmw.</p>

<p>To install Pmw, copy this folder into the
<b>Python&lt;VERSION&gt;\Lib\site-packages</b> folder of your Python
installation. For example if you are using Python 2.3 and it is
installed on the default place on your C: drive, you would copy the
Pmw folder to:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt><b>C:\Python2.3\Lib\site-packages</b></tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<a name="vtk"></a><h3>VTK</h3>
<p>Use the Enthought Python version. No really, do.</p>
