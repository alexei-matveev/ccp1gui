<a name="MolTab"></a><h3>Molecule Tab</h3>
<P align=center><img SRC="images/gamessmoltab.png" alt="Molecule Tab
screenshot" width=350 height=430 ></p>
<p>The options in this tab set up some of the most basic and general
options for the calculation.</p>
<h4>Options Group</h4>
<p>This group sets the basic options for the calculation.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Title</b> - a title for the calculation can be entered
	here. This will be displayed at the head of the GAMESS-UK output
	file.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Task</b> - this can be used to
	select the type of GAMESS-UK calculation that will be undertaken. 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><b>Energy</b> - this undertakes a
		single-point energy evaluation, followed by any
		additional calculations/anaylses that may have been specified.</p>
		<li><p><b>Gradient</b> This forces the
		computation of both the energy and the forces. 
		</p>
		<li><p><b>Geometry Optimisation</b> -
		this optimises the geometry of the molecule by searching for a
		local minimum on the potential energy surface. Additional
		optimisation options can be set in the <b>Optimisation</b> tab. 
		</p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Charge</b> - specify the overall charge on the molecule.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Spin</b> Specify the spin multiplicity of the
	molecule (1 = singlet, 2 = doublet etc.).</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Check Spin</b> - this checks the spin multiplicity of
	the molecule is consistent with the number of electrons in the
	molecule.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Use Symmetry</b> - by default, the GAMESS-UK SCF, MCSCF and CI
	modules are performed internally in a symmetry adapted basis
	set. This involves the automatic generation of a symmetry
	adapted list of functions driven from the input molecular
	geometry and basis specified, and subsequent characterisation
	of the molecular orbitals in terms of the generated list. The
	Use Symmetery option toggles this behaviour on or off.</p>

</ul>

<h4>Basis Selector Group</h4>
<p>The tools in this group are used to select which basis sets are
applied to each of the atoms in the molecule. The currently applied basis
set is shown in the <b>Current Basis Assignment</b> window.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Default Basis</b> - this is used to select the basis set
	that is applied to all the atoms, unless other basis sets are
	specifically applied to atoms of a certain type using the
	<b>Assign by atom type</b> tool. The default basis set for
	GAMESS-UK is the 3-21G split valence basis set.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Assign by Atom Type</b> - the tools
	in this group are used to apply specific basis sets to atoms
	of the specified type within a molecule.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Clicking on the <b>Assign Type</b>
		button will apply the basis set shown in the <b>Choose Basis</b>
		selector to the specified atom type. Any
		changes made in the <b>Default Basis</b> tool will now no longer
		apply to this atom unless it is selected again and the <b>Clear
		Assignment</b> button is pressed. 
		</p>
		<li><p>If the basis set that you require is not available from the
		menus, you can write or paste the basis set specification into the
		<b>Custom Basis Specification</b> window.</p>
	</ul>

<a name="TheoryTab"></a><h3>Theory Tab</h3>
<P align=center><img SRC="images/gamesstheorytab.png" alt="Theory Tab
	screenshot"  width=350 height=430></p>
<h4>Guess Group</h4>
<p>Any SCF calculation requires a guess to be made as to the form of
molecular orbitals or eigenvectors used as a starting point for the
iterative process. The <b>guess</b> menu tool can be used to select
between the three main methods offered by GAMESS.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Compute</b> - the guess is
	calculated using an initial property of
	the molecule. The available options are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><b>atoms</b> - the guess is based
		on concatenating the 1-particle density matrices for each of the
		component atoms of the molecular system. 
		</p>
		<li><p><b>atorbs</b> - the starting
		orbitals are constructed as a
		concatenation of the atomic orbitals of the atoms. This is not
		generally recommended, but is useful for subsequent valence bond
		calculations and for calculations on atoms. 
		</p>
		<li><P<b>hcore</b> - diagonalise the
		1-electron (core) Hamiltonian. This is the most general mechanism
		available, but is also the least reliable in that the resulting MOs
		may often not exhibit the required ordering. 
		</p>
		<li><p><b>minguess</b> - construct and
		diagonalise a Huckel type matrix. This option is limited to minimal
		basis sets (e.g. STO3G), but in such cases often leads to a
		reliable set of MOs. 
		</p>
		<li><p><b>extguess</b> - limited to split-valence basis sets (e.g.,
		3-21G, 4-31G etc.), leading in general to a reliable set of
		orbitals. 
		</p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Dumpfile</b> - the Dumpfile method uses a set of orbitals
	that have been calculated during a previous run of the
	calculation and stored in the dumpfile (which is connected to
	the GAMESS-UK output stream ed3). The orbitals are read from the 
	dumpfile at the section specified by the counter tool. If an
	UHF, GVB or UDFT calculation is performed, two sections will
	need to be specified, one for the alpha orbitals and one for
	the beta. If, for example, the calculation that created the dumpfile was a
	UHF calculation, and the current one is one of RHF, GVB or
	UDFT, then both a and b sections for the current calculation will
	need to point at the section where the orbitals were stored by
	the foregoing RHF calculation (the default for RHF
	calculations being section1). </p>
	<ul>
	<li><p><b>Section a/b</b> - the section where the
	vectors for the &alpha; or &beta; can be found. </p>
	</ul>
	<p> For an explanation of how to specify the
	dumpfile for a calculation see the File Path Group in the <a
	href="#JobTab">Job Tab</a>.</p>

</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>GETQ</b> - this uses a set of orbitals from a
	<i>foreign</i> dumpfile. A foreign dumpfile is the dumpfile
	from a calculation where, for example, the geometry of the
	molecule may be different to the current run, the symmetry
	adapted option was different or a smaller basis set was
	used. In fact the only similarities required to use a dumpfile
	from a previous calcualtion using the GETQ option, is that the
	ordering of the nuclei presented in the z-matrix definition
	lines be the same for both. If the GETQ option is selected,
	the block and section of the dumpfile where the orbtials were
	written to needs to be specified:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><b>Block a/b</b> - the block of the dumpfile
	where the vectors for the &alpha; or &beta; can be found.</p>
		<li><p><b>Section a/b</b> - the section where the
	vectors for the &alpha; or &beta; can be found. </p>
	</ul>
	<p> For an explanation of how to specify the foreign dumpfile for a
	calculation see the File Path Group in the <a
	href="#jobtab">Job Tab</a>.</p>
</ul>
<h4>SCF Options</h4>
<p>The group of options here determine the base SCF calculation
options as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>SCF Method</b> This determines
	the type of SCF calculation that will be undertaken. The available
	options are: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><b>RHF</b> - a Restricted
		Hartree-Fock calculation (closed shell). 
		</p>
		<li><p><b>UHF</b> - an Unrestricted
		Hartree-Fock calculation (open shell). 
		</p>
		<li><b>GVB</b> - a Generalised
		Valence Bond calculation.
		<li><p><b>DFT</b> - a Density Functional
		Theory calculation (closed shell). 
		</p>
		<li><p><b>UDFT</b> - an unrestricted
		Density Functional Theory calculation (open shell). 
		</p>
		<li><p><b>Direct RHF</b> - perform a RHF
		calculation but recalculate the integrals as needed. 
		</p>
		<li><p><b>Direct UHF</b> - perform a UHF
		calculation but recalculate the integrals as needed. 
		</p>
		<li><p><b>Direct GVB</b> - perform a GVB
		calculation but recalculate the integrals as needed. 
		</p>
		<li><p><b>Direct DFT</b> - perform a DFT
		calculation but recalculate the integrals as needed. 
		</p>
		<li><p><b>Direct UDFT</b> - perform a
		UDFT calculation but recalculate the integrals as needed.</p>
	</ul>
	<p></p>
	<li><p><b>Max. Cycles</b> - this sets the
	maximum number of SCF iterations that will be carried out if the
	calculation has not already converged or
	run out of time by then. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>Threshold</b> - this specifies
	the 'accuracy' of the calculation by determining when to stop the
	SCF iterations. This occurs when the value of the
	<i>tester</i> is equal to 10<sup>-<i>n</i></sup>, where
	<i>n</i> is the value specified in the threshold field (the
	<i>tester</i> value is the largest absolute value of the
	occupied/virtual block  of the Fock matrix in the Molecular
	Orbital basis). </p>

	<li><p><b>Bypass SCF</b> - if a previous
	calculation has been carried out the molecule and the resulting
	vectors saved in the GAMESS-UK dumpfile, selecting the bypass
	options causes these results to be used negating the need for a
	fresh SCF calculation. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>SCF Level Shifters</b> The
	tools in this group control the level shifters that can be used to
	control the convergence of an SCF calculation. The level shifters
	work by artificially raising the energy of the virtual
	orbitals <i>E</i> Hartrees above the occupied orbitals,
	thereby artificially stabilising the iterative process and
	improving convergence. The available options are: </p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><b>Initial Levelshifter Value</b>
		- the difference in energy (in Hartrees) between the virtual and
		occupied orbitals for the first <i>n</i> cycles. 
		</p>
		<li><p><b>Cycle to change on</b> - the
		SCF iteration at which the levelshifter value will be altered. 
		</p>
		<li><p><b>Final Levelshifter Value</b> - the energy difference
		between the virtual and occupied orbitals until the
		DIIS solver is in operation. 
		</p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Post SCF Options</h4>
<p>This is used to select amongst the post-SCF calculations available
within GAMESS-UK. The options are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>MCSCF</b> - multi-configuration
	SCF. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>MP2</b> - second-order
	M&oslash;ller-Plesset perturbation. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>MP3</b> - third-order
	M&oslash;ller-Plesset perturbation. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>CCSD</b> - coupled-cluster
	single and double substitution. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>CCSD(T)</b> - coupled-cluster
	single, double and a quasi-perturbative
	estimate for connected triple excitations. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>Direct CI</b> - direct
	configuration interaction. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>MRDCI</b> - multi-reference
	single- and double-excitation configuration interaction. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>Direct MP2</b> - as standard MP2 but recalculate the
	integrals as needed, as opposed to keeping them in memory 
	</p>
</ul>

<a name="DFTTab"></a><h3>Density Functional Theory Tab</h3>
<P align=center><img src="images/gamessdfttab.png" alt="DFT Tab
screenshot"  width=350 height=430></p>
<p>If one of the DFT options was selected in the SCF options in the
Theory tab, then the DFT options here will apply.</p>
<h4>Functional</h4>
<p>The functional tool is used to select the Exchange-Correlation
Functional to be used. Available functionals are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>SVWN</b> - Slater, Vosko, Wilk,
	Nusair functional. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>BLYP</b> - Becke's
	gradient-corrected exchange functional with the Lee-Yang-Parr
	gradient-corrected correlation functional.
		</p>
	<li><p><b>B3LYP</b> - Becke 3-parameter
	hybrid exchange combined with the LYP exchange-correlation
	functional. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>B97</b> - Becke-97 functional. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>HCTH</b> -
	Hamprecht-Cohen-Tozer-Handy pure DFT functional. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>FT97</b> - Filatov and Thiel functional. 
	</p>
</ul>
<h4>Accuracy</h4>
<p>Together, these settings determine the accuracy of the DFT
calculation:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Grid setting</b> - this
	determines the accuracy of the Quadrature Grid. 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><b>low</b> - should only be used
		for preliminary studies; the grid is designed to obtain the total
		number of electrons from the density integration with a relative
		error of 1.0e-4 per atom. 
		</p>
		<li><p><b>medium</b> - this grid is
		designed to obtain a relative error of less than 1.0e-6 in the
		number of electrons per atom. 
		</p>
		<li><p><b>high</b> - the grid is
		designed to obtain a relative error of less than 1.0e-8 in the
		number of electrons per atom. 
		</p>
		<li><p><b>very high</b> - this grid is
		significantly more accurate then the high grid, and is only
		designed to be used for benchmarking calculations. 
		</p>
	</ul>
	<p></p>
	<li><p><b>DFT Weighting Scheme</b> - this
	selects a weighting scheme to combine the atomic integration grids
	to a molecular integration grid. Available schemes are: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><b>Becke</b> - the original Becke
		weighting scheme. 
		</p>
		<li><p><b>MHL</b> - the Murray, Handy
		and Laming weighting scheme. This leads to more accurate integrals
		than the Becke scheme. 
		</p>
		<li><p><b>SSF</b> - the Stratmann,
		Scuseria and Frisch weighting scheme, which seems to be the most
		accurate for large quadrature grids. 
		</p>
		<li><p><b>MHL4SSF</b> - the Stratmann,
		Scuseria and Frisch weighting scheme with screening, but employing
		the cell function by Murray, Handy and Laming weighting scheme with
		&mu; equal to 4. 
		</p>
		<li><p><b>MHL8SSF</b> - as above but with &mu; equal to 8. 
		</p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Quadrature Types</h4>
<p>The settings here allow the type of angular and radial integration
grid to be specified explicitly.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Radial Grid</b> - this
	determines the settings for the radial integration grid. Available
	options are: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><b>default</b> - the default
		setting will apply. 
		</p>
		<li><p><b>Euler-MacLaurin</b> - the
		Euler-MacLaurin grid will be used. If this option is selected, a
		tool will be displayed that allows the number of gridpoints to be
		selected. 
		</p>
		<li><p><b>Mura-Knowles</b> - the Mura-Knowles grid will be used. If
		this option is selected, a tool will be displayed that allows the
		number of gridpoints to be selected.</p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Angular Grid</b> - this
	determines the settings for the angular integration grid. Available
	options are: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><b>default</b> - the default
		setting will apply. 
		</p>
		<li><p><b>Lebedev-Laikov</b> - the
		Lebedev-Laikov grid will be used. If this option is selected, a
		tool will be displayed that allows the number of gridpoints to be
		selected. 
		</p>
		<li><p><b>Gauss-Legendre</b> - the Mura-Legendre grid will be used.
		If this option is selected, a tool will be displayed that allows
		the number of gridpoints to be selected.</p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Coulomb Fitting</h4>
<p>Coulomb fitting reduces the cost associated with DFT calculations
of medium sized molecules by avoiding the calculation of 4-center
2-electron integrals. This can be achieved by choosing a functional
without Hartree-Fock exchange and evaluating the Coulomb energy with
an auxiliary basis set. The tools in this group control Coulomb
Fitting.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Use Coulomb Fitting</b> - if
	this box is selected, Coulomb fitting is turned on and two
	additional tools are displayed that allow the fitting to be
	configured: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><b>Fitting Basis</b> - Coulomb
		fitting requires an additional basis set
		for the atoms in the molecule, and the options here are used to
		determine the basis set to be used. Available options are: 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p><b>A1DGAUSS</b> - use the
			A1-DGAUSS fitting set. 
			</p>
			<li><p><b>A2DGAUSS</b> - use the
			A2-DGAUSS fitting set. 
			</p>
			<li><p><b>DEMON</b> - use the DeMon
			fitting set. 
			</p>
			<li><p><b>AHLRICHS</b> - use the fitted
			basis sets tabulated by Ahlrichs and co-workers. 
			</p>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<p></p>
	<li><p><b>Schwarz Cutoff</b> - the number
	of 3-centre integrals can be reduced by neglecting
	those that are small enough to be considered insignificant. The
	Schwarz inequality is used to decide the
	cutoff point below which integrals are not important, with the
	Schwarz tolerance being set to 10<SUP>-<i>n</i></SUP>,
	where <i>n</i> is the number entered in the box.</p>
</ul>
<hr>
<a name="PropTab"></a><h3>Properties Tab</h3>
<P align=center><img SRC="images/gamessproptab.png" border="1"
	alt="Properties Tab screenshot" width=350 height=430></p>
<p>The options here define the molecular properties to be calculated
by GAMESS-UK. The upper half of the tab is used to control the
<i>graphical options</i> that are to be plotted. The magnitudes of
these particular molecular properties are mapped to a grid, the
properties of which can be specified with the <a
href="#editgrid">Edit Grid</a> option. The molecular properties
that can be calculated are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Difference Density</b> - this
	calculates the difference between the total electron density
	associated with a molecule and the sum of the electron densities of
	the atoms which constitute the molecule, but which are assumed to
	have undergone no interactions with each other, and have remained
	undistorted as in the free state. As such, it provides an indication
	of the overall rearrangement of density which occurs when the atoms
	come together upon molecular formation. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>Potential</b> - the value of
	the electrostatic potential created by the electronic distribution
	and nuclear charge of the molecule. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>HOMO/LUMO</b> - the Highest
	Occupied Molecular Orbital and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular
	Orbital. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>HOMO<i>n</i>/LUMO<i>n</i></b> - the
	<i>n<sup>th</sup></i> orbital in energy below the HOMO and the
	<i>n<sup>th</sup></i> orbital above the LUMO. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>Charge Density</b> - the
	electron density associated with the molecule. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>Difference Density</b> - this
	calculates the difference between the total electron density
	associated with a molecule and the sum of the electron densities of
	the atoms which constitute the molecule, but which are assumed to
	have undergone no interactions with each other, and have remained
	undistorted as in the free state. As such, it provides an indication
	of the overall rearrangement of density which occurs when the atoms
	come together upon molecular formation. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>Potential</b> - the value of
	the electrostatic potential created by the electronic distribution
	and nuclear charge of the molecule. 
	</p>
</ul>

<p> The options in lower half of the tab determine that GAMESS-UK
	should calculate the force constants that determine the
	vibrational frequencies of the molecule. This can be done in
	two ways namely:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><p><b>Finite Difference</b> - this indicates that
	GAMESS-UK will calculate the force constants numerically
	by taking finite differences of the gradient using a one-point
	formula.</li> 
	<li><p><b>Analytic</b> - this option is a combination of
	tasks, requesting integral generation, SCF, gradient
	evaluation (with additional evaluation of derivative Fock
	operators), integral transformation, solution of the coupled
	Hartree-Fock (CHF) equations, calculation of the two-electron
	second derivative contribution and, finally, determination of
	the projected harmonic frequencies. This approach is generally
	more accurate than the numerical approach, but is only
	vialable for SCF and DFT wavefunctions, together
	with MP2 closed-shell wavefunctions.</li> 
	<p><i><b>NB:</b> the above options are only applicable if
	the geometry of the molecule has already been optimised in a
	previous calculation or if an optimisation is carried out as
	part of the current calculation.</i></p>
	</p>
</ul>

<a name="EditGrid"><h4>Edit Grid</h4></a>
<P align=center><img SRC="images/gamessgridedit.png" alt="Grid Editor
screenshot"></p>
<p>When a graphical analysis option is selected, the GAMESS-UK
calculation will output a grid of points where the selected molecular
property has been calculated at each point. The <b>Edit Grid</b>
button brings up a separate window which
can be used to tune the properties of the Grid. The options available
for the grid are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>X,Y,Z Tran</b> - the slider can be
	used to shift the origin of the grid's x,y, or
	z-axis. Alternatively the shift can be specified in Angstroms
	and entered in the box to the right of the slider. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>X,Y,Z Rot</b> - the slider can be used to rotate the
	grid about the x,y or z-axis. Alternatively the angle of
	rotation can be entered in the box to the right of the
	slider. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>X,Y,Z Scale</b> - the slider can be used to scale
	the length of the x,y or z-axis, or the relative
	value can be entered in the box to the right. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>nx, ny, nz</b> - this counter is used
	to specify the 'mesh density' along the x,y or z-axis. For rectangular
	grids, this is the total number of points along the axis. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>Transform</b> - apply any
	changes that are pending. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>Close and Save</b> - close the
	Grid Editor window and return to the calculation window, saving any
	changes that have been made. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>Reset</b> - reset the grid to
	its default values. 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>Close and Cancel</b> - close the Grid Editor window and
	return to the calculation window, but discard any changes that have
	been made.

<h4>Runtype Group</h4>
<p>The options in this group determine the type of geometry
optimisation that will be carried out.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Opt. Coords</b> - this
	determines the optimisation method that will be used. The options
	are: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><b>Z-Matrix</b> - this selects a
		quasi-Newton rank-2 update procedure in internal coordinates. This
		is the recommended method but requires the molecular coordinates to
		have been specified in internal coordinate
		form and the variables that are to be optimised to have been
		specified. 
		</p>
		<li><p><b>Cartesian</b> - if this is selected the optimisation uses
		a Cartesian-driven update method. The
		Cartesian geometry optimisation cannot be
		used when searching for a transition state or using the
		Jorgensen/Simmons optimisation algorithm.</p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Locate Transition State</b> - if this checkbox is selected
	then the geometry optimisation will not
	search for the global minimum, but will instead try and determine
	the geometry of a transition state. A transition state search can
	only be undertaken if the z-matrix is in internal coordinate form
	and the variables that are to be optimised have been specified.</p>
</ul>
<h4>Search Procedure Group</h4>
<p>The options in this group allow the user a certain amount
of control over the implementation of the selected optimisation
strategy.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Energy evaluations</b> - this number determines the
	maximum number of energy evaluations (geometry optimisation <i>steps</i>)
	that will be permitted.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Line searches</b> - this is the maximum number of line
	searches that will be permitted during the optimisation.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Convergence Thresh.</b> - this determines the convergence
	threshold: the point at which the geometry
	optimisation is deemed to have converged. 
	</p>
	<p>For a <i>Z-matrix minimisation</i> or <i>Transition State Search</i>, this is
	when:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>maximum change in variables <b>&lt;</b>
		Convergence Threshold 
		</p>
		<li><p>average change in variables <b>&lt;</b>
		Convergence Threshold * 2/3 
		</p>
		<li><p>maximum gradient <b>&lt;</b>
		Convergence Threshold * 4/9 
		</p>
		<li><p>average gradient <b>&lt;</b> Convergence Threshold * 8/27</p>
	</ul>
	<p>For a Cartesian optimisation, this is when:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>The maximum component of the gradient is equal to the value
		specified for the Convergence Threshold.</p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Max. Step Size</b> - this determines the largest change
	that will be permitted to be made to variables during the
	optimisation. If a <i>Z-Matrix minimisation</i> or
	<i>Transition State Search</i> is being carried out this this number
	determines the maximum change in bond length in Bohrs, or change in
	bond angle in radians. For a Cartesian
	optimisation the number specifies the maximum permitted change in
	the Cartesian coordinates.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Turning Point Accuracy </b>- This option is only
	applicable to a <i>Z-Matrix minimisation</i> or <i>Transition
	State Search</i> and controls the accuracy of the search for a
	turning point during a line search. This value should be set
	between 0.0 and 1.0, with a smaller value leading to a more
	accurate line search.</p>
</ul>
<h4>Jorgensen Group</h4>
<p>If the checkbox is selected it indicates that the Jorgensen/Simmons
quasi-Newton-Raphson minimisation algorithm should be used. This is
only applicable when a <i>Z-Matrix minimisation</i> or <i>Transition
State Search</i> is being undertaken.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Hessian Update Procedure</b> - this option is only
	displayed if the geometry optimisation is searching for a minimum
	and not a transition state. If displayed it can be used to select
	whether the Hessian update procedure is the default, BFGS, or BFGSX
	(a modified BFGS update procedure with safeguards to ensure
	retention of a positive definite Hessian).</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Use Powell Hessian Update</b> - this option is only
	displayed if a transition search is being undertaken and determines
	that the Hessian should be updated using the Powell update
	procedure.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Min. Hessian Eigenvalue</b> - the minimum permitted value
	for a Hessian eigenvalue.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Max Hessian Eigenvalue </b>- the maximum permitted value
	for a Hessian eigenvalue</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Use Rational Function Optimisation</b> - this is
	used to control the nature of the steps taken in the search
	procedure. If RFO is selected, a menu is presented that allows
	the user to select the default specification for RRO. 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>ON</b> - only RFO or P-RFO
		steps will be taken.
		<li><p><b>OFF</b> - Newton-Raphson steps will be taken where
		appropriate, instead of RFO or P-RFO steps.</p>
	</ul>
</ul>

<p align=center><img src="images/gamessjobtab.png" border="1" alt="Job
		Tab screenshot"width=350 height=430></p>
<p>The tools in this tab set up various external atrributes of the
GAMESS-UK that will be run.</p>

<h4>Job Group</h4>
<p>The tools in this group are used to configure the environment that
the GAMESS-UK job will be run in.</p><ul>

	<li><p><b>Jobname</b> - the name of the GAMESS-UK job. All of
	the files created by the calculation will have whatever
	<i>jobname</i> has been specified as, as their stem unless
	they are specifically renamed using the tools in the file path
	group (see below). </p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Hostname</b> - the name of the host where the calculation
	is being run. If your GAMESS-UK executable is located on your local
	machine (i.e. the computer you are running the GUI on), this
	should be set to localhost.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Job Submission</b> - this is not
	active at present.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>User Name</b> - the UNIX username of the user submitting
	the job.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Working Directory</b> - this is used to select
	the directory where the GAMESS-UK input file, and any output files
	, will be created.</p>
</ul>

<h4>File Path Group</h4>
<p>The tools in this tab set the names and locations of the files that
will be connected to the various ed streams used by GAMESS-UK.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>ECP Libraries</b> - ed0 is used to specify the
	directory containing the pseudopotential libraries used for non-local
	pseudopotential calculations. If the <b>specify</b> button is
	clicked, a text window and browse button will appear, which
	can be used to specify the location of this directory.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Mainfile (ed2)</b> - this file is used to hold the
	two electron integrals generated by GAMESS-UK. If the
	<b>keep</b> button is selected, this file will be saved in the
	directory the calculation is run in, with the name specified by
	the <i>jobname</i> tool and the suffix <kbd>.ed2</kbd>. If the
	<b>specify</b> button is selected, the name and location can
	be specifed as desired.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Dumpfile (ed3)</b> - the dumpfile holds a variety of
	information including the eigenvectors, restart information 
  	Hessians, CI-coefficients etc. You must save the dumpfile for
	a calculation if you intend to undertake any subsequent
	calculations based on the results of this calculation. It is
	also vital to specify the dumpfile you wish to use if you are
	performing a calculation that requires any information
	contained in the dumpfile from a previous calculation. It is important to
	note that the dumpfile from a previous calculation will be
	overwritten with the new values if it is specifed here.</p>

	<p>If this is the first of a series of calculations and no
	information from previous calculations is requried, the
	<b>keep</b> button will cause the dumpfile for this
	calculation to be saved in the directory the calculation is
	running in, with the name specified by
	the <i>jobname</i> tool and the suffix
	<kbd>.ed3</kbd>. Alternatively, the <b>specify</b> button can
	be used to select an arbitrary name and location. If the
	current calculation uses information from a previous
	calculation, then the same applies, but the eigenvector
	information will be read from this file, before
	the values are overwritten with those for the current calculation.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Tempfile (ed7)</b> - this file is the temporary file
	used by GAMESS-UK and holds various housekeeping information
	used by the program as it runs. Normally this file is located
	in the directory specified by the GAMESS_TMP environment
	variable, or, failing that, the directory specified by the GAMESS_SCR enviroment
	variable, or, as a last resort, the directory that the
	calculation runs in. If for any reason you believe there may
	not be enough space in any of these directories, or they are
	located on disks that are not fast enough, an alternative
	location can be specifed with this tool. If the
	<b>keep</b> button is selected, this file will be saved in the
	directory the calculation is run in, with the name specified by
	the <i>jobname</i> tool and the suffix <kbd>.ed7</kbd>. If the
	<b>specify</b> button is selected, the name and location can
	be specifed as desired.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Foreign Dumpfile (ed14)</b> - this is used to
	specify the location of a <i>foreign</i> dumpfile. For more
	information about foreign dumpfiles see the <b>GETQ</b> option
	in the <b>Guess Section</b> of the <a href="#TheoryTab">Theory
	Tab</a>. It is important to note that if a file is specified
	as a foreign dumpfile, it is only <i>read from</i> and not
	written to. If the dumpfile for the current calculation is to
	be kept, it should be specified with the ed3 dumpfile tool
	described above.</p>
	<p>If the <b>specify</b> button is clicked, a text window and browse button will appear, which
	can be used to specify the location of this file.</p>
