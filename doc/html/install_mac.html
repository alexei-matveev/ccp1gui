<h1 align=center>Installation of the packages for the CCP1GUI
under Mactintosh</h1>

<h2>Base Packages</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, the version of Python that ships with OSX (Darwin at
any rate) does not include Tk/Tcl or Tkinter by default, so
you will need to install these packages first.</p>

<a name="mactcl"><h3>Tcl/Tk Aqua</h3>
<p>Tcl/Tk for MacOSX can be downloaded from <a
href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/unix_open_source/tcltkaqua.html">Apple</a>
- just follow the instructions for installing them.</p>

<a name="numeric"></a><h3> Tkinter ( Numeric Python and IDLE )</h3>
<p>The next step is to install the Mac Python add-ons, which include a
Package Manager tool that you can use to install Tkinter ( as well as Numeric
Python and IDLE ). You can get the Package Manger 
 from <a
href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~jack/macpython/download.html">MacPython
website</a>. Once you have installed this, it will create a folder
call <b><tt>MacPython-<i>version</i></b></tt> ( where version is the
version of Python you are using  - e.g. 2.3 ) in your Applications
folder. Use the Finder to navigate to this folder and then run
<tt>PackageManager</tt> program.</p>

<small><blockquote><b>NB:</b> If this crashes on opening with a
message about being unable to open a &quot;.plist&quot; file, then the
Package Manager is looking at the wrong online database to get it's
list of available packages. To find out about current databases, visit the
<a href="http://www.python.org/packman/">packman</a> webpage and get
the url for a suitable database. Then in PackageManager, select
<b>File -&gt; Open Url...</b> and paste in the
url.</small></blockquote>

<p>In the package manager then select the following packages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Numeric-<i>version</i>-binary</li>
<li>_tkinter-<i>version</i>-binary</li>
<li>IDLE-<i>version</i>-binary</li>
</ul>

<p>(where version will be a different number depending on the
version) and then click the <b>install</b> button at the bottom of
the page to install the packages.</p>

<p>If the above commands work for you, you should now be in a position
to download one of the software bundles. Only read on if you need to
install the additional packages yourself.</p>

<h2 align="center">Additional Packages</h2>

<a name="scientific"></a><h3>Scientific Python</h3>
<p>The Scientific Python <a
href="http://starship.python.net/~hinsen/ScientificPython/">Website</a>
has links for Mac installers that you can download. If these aren't
available or you think installers are for wusses and you crave the
command-line, then you can follow the instructions for installing
Scientific under <a
href="./install_unix.html#scientific">Unix/Linux</a>.</p>

<a name="pmw"></a><h3>Python MegaWidgets</h3>

<p>Pmw is just pure Python code, and so doesn't need to be installed
as such, just copied into a place where Python can find it. A link to
a download of a tarred and zipped archive is available on the Pmw <a
href="http://pmw.sourceforge.net/">webpage</a>.
You should be able to unpack the archive with the command:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt><b>tar -xvzf Pmw.1.2.tar.gz</b></tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This will give you a folder called <b>Pmw</b> To install Pmw, copy this folder into the
<b>site-packages</b> folder of your python installation, as show below. This
command applies to Python 2.3 as installed as a framework build -
please change the version number (2.3) to whatever is suitable for
your installation if it is different. If you've
built your own python, just copy the Pmw folder into the
<b><tt>lib/site-packages</tt></b> of your install tree.</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt><b>cp -R Pmw /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/lib/python2.3/site-packages</b></tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<a name="vtk"></a><h3>VTK</h3>
<p>Most of the instructions for building under <a
href="./install_unix.html#vtk">Unix/Linux</a> should apply, but you
will first need to ensure you have a compiler installed, which you can
do by installing the MacOSX developer tools from the installation CD,
which includes gcc.</p>
