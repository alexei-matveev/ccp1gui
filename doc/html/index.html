    <h1>The CCP1 GUI Project</h1>

<H3> Introduction</H3>

<p>The CCP1GUI project has arisen as a result of demand within the UK
academic community (principally through CCP1) for a free, extensible
Graphical User Interface (GUI) for community codes, particularly for
teaching purposes. There is also a long-standing requirement for a
graphical interface for the GAMESS-UK quantum chemistry programme,
which we plan to satisfy using the CCP1 developments.</p>

<p>The GUI has been built around the Python open-source programming
language and the VTK visualisation toolkit, both of which have been
ported to all the major operating system platforms. The GUI is
therefore capable of running on all of these systems. Distributions of
the GUI have already been successfully tested on Windows, and Suse and
Redhat Linux distributions, and packages for these distributions are
freely available from our ftp site.</p>

<p>The CCP1GUI has been released under the GNU <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL">GPL</a> licence
and is freely available to download. Downloads are available from the
CCP1GUI pages on <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ccp1gui/">sourceforge</a> or
from the <a href="ftp://ftp.dl.ac.uk/qcg/ccp1gui/">ftp site</a> of the
Quantum Chemistry Group at Daresbury Laboratory.</p>

<p>The design of the GUI makes the most of Python's high degree of
object-orientation, including advanced features such as multiple
inheritance that are not available in other object-oriented languages
such as C++ and Java. The strong reliance on object orientation means
that it is quick and easy to create interfaces to new computational
chemistry codes as the need arises. The GUI already has a
highly-featured interface for the GAMESS-UK program, and there are
working interfaces for ChemShell and MOPAC.</p>

<h3>Supported file formats</h3>
<p>From its inception, the GUI was intended to work with a number of
different codes, so a variety of file formats are supported both for
reading in molecular structures and outputting data. As well as
conventional formats such as Z-matrix and PDB, there are
programme-specific formats for CHARMM, ChemShell, XMol and Gaussian,
as well as support for XML.</p>

<h3>Editing Capabilities</h3>
<p>The GUI has a suite of easy-to-use editing tools that allows
complex molecules to be created using simple point-and-click
operations. There is also a fully-functional Z-matrix editor that can
be used to edit the atomic coordinates of a molecule in internal or
Cartesian form. Symbolic variables (and constants) can be defined, and
the editor can automatically generate a Z-matrix (including the
requisite reordering of the atoms) which can subsequently be
customised. Used in conjunction with the graphical tools this creates
a powerful and flexible environment for building molecular
structures.</p>

<h3>Visualisation Tools</h3>
<p>The GUI has powerful and highly customisable visualisation
capabilities. It can create coloured 3D-surfaces, 2D-slices or grids
of points mapped to a desired molecular property, and the colours and
opacity are easily adapted to a given schema. Multiple representations
of the various molecular properties for the same or different
molecules can be created and overlaid to extract the maximum amount of
information from the results of a calculation.</p>

<p>The GUI can also be used to view the dynamic properties of a
calculation, by animating molecular vibrations or creating a movie
from the different steps in a geometry optimisation.</p>


<h3>Driving GAMESS-UK</h3>
<p>The GAMESS-UK interface for the GUI can be used to drive SCF, DFT
or post Hartree-Fock calculations, or to undertake geometry
optimisations, including transition state searches. There are options
to configure everything from the convergence criteria of SCF
calculations and geometry optimisations, to functionals and grid
settings for DFT calculations. In addition, the interface includes a tool to
configure the basis sets on individual atoms.</p>

<p>The interface also provides access to the various analytical
options offered by GAMESS-UK and the results of these calculations are
automatically imported into the GUI for display with the visualisation
tools.</p>

<h3>e-Science Developments</h3>
<p>Work is already underway to enable the GUI to exploit the latest
developments in the field of e-Science. Initially these will allow the
GUI to download molecular structures from databases around the world
for viewing, or to serve as the inputs for calculations. As the
e-Science Data Model matures however, it will become possible to not
only download and view the results of calculations carried out with
different codes, but to use the GUI to import the inputs to serve as a
basis for new calculations.</p>
