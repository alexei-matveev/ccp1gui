<p>This file contains a concise listing of changes to the CCP1GUI that were
  made with each release.</p>

<h4>Version 0.8 - release date: 28th May 2010</h4>

<ul>
<li>Removal of the reliance on Numeric/Scientific Python - wrappers have
been written so that we can use either numpy or Numeric if they are
available, and it is no longer a fatal error if neither of them are
present (although certain functionality will not be available).</li>

<li>Tools have been added to change the lengths of bonds and to rotate
fragments of molecules about a bond.</li>

<li>An interface to the iPython shell has been added, to allow an
iPython shell to be opened from within the CCP1GUI.</li>

<li>Images can now be saved as TIFF files.</li>

<li>The molecular rendering code has been updated so that it is now
possible to view all the different renderers separately; previously
the sticks representation relied on the wireframe representation being
present.</li>

<li>&quot;Data summary&quot; widgets have been added to the vector visualiser
classes so that information on the numerical data being visualised can
be seen.</li>

<li>The GAMESS-UK output reader now returns trajectory objects and
vibration visualisers instead of just molecule objects.</li>

<li>A single instance of FileIO objects can now read in multiple
files.</li>

<li>The CCP1GUI should now be started by the ccp1gui.py file in the
main directory. This script checks for any import errors and displays
information on what modules need to be installed for the CCP1GUI to
function properly. This replaces the ccp1gui.sh file under unix and
ccp1gui.bat file under Windows.</li>

<li>The unittesting framework has been updated and new tests
added. There is now a testall.py script in the main directory that
cycles through a number of these tests and provides a quick way to
check that the basic functionality is working.</li>

<li>The documentation and project website have been updated.</li>

<li>Additional examples have been added to the examples directory to
increase unittesting coverage.</li>

<li>The molecular picking code has been updated so that it is now
possible to select atoms in the sphere representation without the
wireframe representation being present.</li>

<li>Added the option to edit a grid that has been read in.</li>

<li>Added menu option to get bond length and angle listing</li>

<li>Save as now supports .res format.</li>

<li>Load from file can now load GAMESS-UK output format.</li>

<li>Improved handling of GAMESS-UK restarts (including a better choice for 
directory defaults)</li>

<li>Molecular editing now includes addition of fragments (a selection of R groups
and pi-bound ligands is added)</li>

<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2992807&group_id=138504&atid=740862">Bug 2992807</a> with the "add fragment" tool has been fixed.</li>

<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2992810&group_id=138504&atid=740862">Bug 2292810</a> with the MNDO calculation editor has ben fixed.</li>


</ul>

<li>sv 6-31G, cc-pvdz, cc-pvtz, cc-pvqz and cc-pv5z basis sets added
for GAMESS-UK.</li>

<li>'Write Input' method added for Mopac calculations.</li>
<li>Right-clicking in the Grid Editor now brings up a menu to output
different formats of the grids.</li>
<li>Enabled error trapping of stderr for some calculations so that the
errors can be reported in dialog widgets.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
