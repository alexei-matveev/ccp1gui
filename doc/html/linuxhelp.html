<h1 align=center>Installing Software Under Linux</h1>
<h2>Using RPM</h2>
<p>RPM is the RPM Package Manager used to manage the installation of
software on a variety of Linux distributions. More information on rpm
can be found at <a href="http://www.rpm.org">www.rpm.org</a>. What 
follows is a brief overview
of the types of commands you will need to use to get the CCP1 GUI
working.</p>

<h3>Querying  a package</h3>
<p>To check if you have a package installed open a shell and
enter:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>rpm -q <i>&lt;package&gt;</i></tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>where <i>&lt;package&gt;</i> is the name of the package, for example 
'python' for
Python, 'tk' for Tk, 'tcl' for Tcl and 'vtk' for VTK. If you are not
sure what the package is called, or are seraching for packages
relating to a particular package, try the command:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>rpm -qa | grep -i '<i>&lt;name&gt;</i>'</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This queries the entire database of installed packages outputing a
line for each package that contains the string <i>&lt;name&gt;</i>.</p>

<p>The output of these commands will not only tell you if you have the
package installed, but what version you are using. This assumes the
packages have been installed as rpm files - if you've installed them
from source the rpm database will have no record of them.</p>

<h3>Installing an rpm package</h3>
<p>Sofwtare distributed as rpm packages are optimised for various
linux distributions and machine architechtures, so you will need to
know what sort of processor you are running. To find this out, open a
shell and type the command:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>uname -ps</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This will display the version of the operating system you are using
and the type of processor (e.g intel/pentium: i386, i586 etc), alpha
etc.). Rpm packages for a particular architecture usually have
suffices such as i386.rpm or alpha.rpm so you can select the correct 
one.</p>

<p>Download the rpm package for your system/architecture to a directory 
on your
harddrive (it isn't too important where you save the file, as the rpm
program that installs the program will copy all of the relevant files
to the correct directories on your hard drive, allowing you to delete
the rpm file afterwards if desired).</p>

<p>To install the rpm package, open a shell and cd into the directory
where you downloaded the file. You will probably need to be root to 
have the
relevant priviledges requried to run the installation, so type 'su' at 
the command
prompt and enter your root password. As root enter:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>rpm -ivh <i>&lt;package_name&gt;</i></tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>where <i>&lt;package_name&gt;</i> is the rpm file you downloaded. 
You should see a
series of hash marks (####) indicating the progress of the
installation and a message telling you if the installation was
succesful.</p>

<h2>Untarring and unzipping archives.</h2>
<p>Many software packages are distributed as tarred and zipped
archives. If a package has the suffix .tar, it indicates that it is a
tar archive (several files and/or directories bundled into a single
file). An additional bz or gz suffix (e.g. .tar.gz or .tar.bz)
indicates that the package has been compressed with the gzip (gz) or
bzip2 (.bz) utilities.</p>

<p>If a package (<i>&lt;package_name&gt;</i>) has been compresed with
gzip or bzip, cd into the directory where the package resides and
enter:</p>

<table border="0" width="100%">
<tr>
<td bgcolor=#e0e0e0><tt>gzip -d <i>&lt;package_name&gt;</i></tt></td>
<td  align=center> or </td>
<td bgcolor=#e0e0e0><tt>gunzip
<i>&lt;package_name&gt;</i></tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>if the file has been gzipped (.gz) or:</p>

<table border="0" width="100%">
<tr>
<td bgcolor=#e0e0e0><tt>bzip2 -d <i>&lt;package_name&gt; </i></tt></td>
<td align=center> or </td>
<td bgcolor=#e0e0e0 ><tt>bunzip2 <i>&lt;package_name&gt;</i></tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>if it has been bzipped. This will decompress the file and leave you
with a file ending with a .tar suffix. To untar the file and create
the directory type:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>tar -xvf <i>&lt;package_name&gt;</i></tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Alternatively, if your version of tar supports it, you can 
accomplish both steps in one go by typing:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>tar -xvzf <i>&lt;package_name&gt;</i></tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>for a gzipped archive or: </p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>tar -xvjf <i>&lt;package_name&gt;</i></tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>for a bzipped package.</p>
