<body>
<h1 align=center>The CCP1 Graphical User Interface</h1>

<p>All of the packages needed to get the CCP1GUI running are freely
available on the web and many come pre-installed on most modern
operating systems. A number of the packages are not &quot;standard&quot; and so
are unlikely to be installed on your computer unless you put them
there.</p>

<p>To get the CCP1GUI running on your system you can either
download a file containing all of the additional packages required
for your Operating System together with the CCP1GUI source code from
our <a href="ftp://ftp.dl.ac.uk/qcg/ccp1gui">ftp site</a> as described in
the <a href="#easyinstall">Easy Installation</a>
instructions, or you can download the latest CCP1GUI
package from the CCP1GUI pages on <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ccp1gui/">sourceforge</a> and
install all of the additional packages yourself, as described in the
sections below for <a href="#linux">Linux</a>, <a
href="#macosx">Macintosh</a> and <a href="#windows">Windows</a>
users.</p>

<a name="easyinstall"><h2 align=center>Easy Installation</h2></a>

<small><blockquote><b>NB:</b> Python, Tcl/Tk and Tkinter (the interface between Python and Tk/Tcl)
should come pre-installed on most modern operating systems and the
rest of these instructions assume that they are. If they are not,
please read the sections below for <a href="#linux">Linux</a>, <a
href="#macosx">Macintosh</a> or <a href="#windows">Windows</a> for
instructions on how to get hold of them ( they all are freely
available ).</small></blockquote>

<p>To get the archive file containing the CCP1GUI and all of the
packages it depends on, go the to ccp1gui <a
href="ftp://ftp.dl.ac.uk/ccp1gui">ftp site</a>. You should be able to
do this with your browser, if not you can use a command-line ftp
client. To do this open a terminal on Linux / Unix / MacOSX or fire up the
Windows command-prompt and type:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>ftp ftp.dl.ac.uk</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>When promted for a password enter <tt>anonymous</tt> and just hit
enter when asked for a password. Then cd to the ccp1gui directory.</p>

<p>The packages in the ccp1gui directory are organised according to
Operating System (OS), OS version and processor-type ( if applicable ). The
individual packages are named according to their directory, together
with the name ccp1gui_bundle and the suffix <tt>.tar.gz</tt> for Unix
or <tt>.zip</tt> for windows. For example, if you are running Redhat
Linux 9.0 on an i586 ( i.e. pentium-type ) processor, you would
download the file:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>/qcg/ccp1gui/redhat/9.0/i586/redhat-9.0-i586-ccp1gui_bundle.tar.gz</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>If you are running Windows XP ( which will be running on a Pentium
processor ), the file would be:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>/qcg/ccp1gui/windows/xp/windows-xp-ccp1gui_bundle.zip</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Once you have downloaded the file, you will need to upack it. To do
this on unix systems, use the tar and gzip utilties ( see the <a
href="linuxhelp.html">Linux Help</a> section for instructions on how
to do this ) or use the Winzip utility on Windows.</p>

<p>The file will unpack to give a folder called
<b><tt>ccp1gui_bundle</tt></b>, which has the following structure:</p>

<pre>

                  |--data/
ccp1gui_bundle/---|--ccp1gui.sh ( or ccp1gui.bat )
                  |--Numeric/
		  |--Numeric.pth
		  |--Scientific/
		  |--Pmw/
		  |--vtk/
		  |
		  |           |-- basis/
		  |           |-- ccp1gui.sh
		  |--ccp1gui/-|-- chempy/
		              |-- CVS/
			      |-- doc/------|--html/
			      |-- examples/
			      |-- generic/
			      |-- idle/
			      |-- interfaces/
			      |-- jobmanager/
			      |-- LICENCE
			      |-- objects
			      |-- scripts
			      |-- viewer

</pre>

<p> The script <tt>ccp1gui.sh</tt> on Unix/Linux/MacOSX systems and
<tt>ccp1gui.bat</tt> on Windows systems in the ccp1gui_bundle
directory should be used to start the CCP1GUI.</p>

<small><blockquote><b>NB:</b> Mac OSX users will need to run the script
<b><tt>setpaths.sh</tt></b> before trying to run the CCP1GUI, as
otherwise the paths to the VTK libraries are likely to be wrong.</blockquote></small>

<p>On Unix and Linux systems, make sure the script is executable with the command:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>chmod +x ccp1gui.sh</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p> and then run it with the command:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>./ccp1gui.sh</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p> On Windows, just double-click on the <tt>ccp1gui.bat</tt>
file.</p>


<h3>Upgrading</h3>

<p>If you would like to upgrade your version of the CCP1GUI ( if you
hear of any new bug fixes or additional features you would like to
take advantage of ), you will need to download a new <b>ccp1gui</b>
directory to replace your current version. </p>

<p>The latest version of this directory is available for download from
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ccp1gui/">sourceforge</a> or
as the file <tt>ccp1gui-latest.tar.gz</tt> on our
<a href="ftp://ftp.dl.ac.uk/qcg/ccp1gui/">ftp site</a>.

<p>Remove  ( or rename ) the old <b><tt>ccp1gui</tt></b> directory,
download the new file into your <b><tt>ccp1gui_bundle</tt></b>
directory and unnpack it  so that the new
directory <b><tt>ccp1gui</tt></b> replaces the old one. You can then
run the <tt>ccp1gui.sh</tt> or <tt>ccp1gui.bat</tt> script as
before.</p>

<hr width=75%>

<h2 align=center>Installing the packages individually</h2>

<a name="linux"><h3>Linux</h3></a>

<p>Before following the instructions below, you should query the
package management for your Linux distribution to see if these
packages are already available to you ( as it is likely to make life a
lot easier for you ). The additional packages you will need to ensure are on your
system are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tcl ( Tool Command Language )</li>
<li>Tk ( Tk Toolkit )</li>
<li>Tkinter ( aka python-tk )</li>
<li>Numeric Python ( aka python-numeric or numpy )</li>
<li>Scientific Python ( aka python-scientific )</li>
<li>Python Megawidgets ( aka Pmw )</li>
</ul>

<p>The majority of these should be available under yast with Suse,
apt-get with Debian, yum under Redhat or emerge under Gentoo. If they are not ( as is
likely to be the case for Pmw  at least ) read the instructions below on how to
install them.</p>

<p>Even if the packages aren't available through your package manger,
then you may be able to find rpm distributions of the relevant
packages ( if you are running Redhat, Suse or their ilk ). A good
place to start looking for rpm packages is the <a
href="http://www.rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/">rpmfind</a> site.</p>

<p>If can't find all of the packages mentioned above then you will
need to install them manually as described below.</p>

<small><blockquote><b>NB:</b> The following are only general instructions that were correct at the
time of writing. Software being what it is however, they are likely to
become out of date fairly quickly. In all cases however, there should
be up-to-date instructions on how to install the packages on their
websites or included as README files in any downloads. The
notes here should only be taken as a guide and you are strongly
advised to read the documentation supplied with the packages to
determine the best way to install them.</small></blockquote>

<a name="linuxpython"></a><h4>Python</h4>
<p>There are are a range of different python distributions in use:
python 1.5, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4. The CCP1GUI should work quite happily
with most of these.</p>

<p>If for some unaccountable reason Python isn't installed on your
system, it is available as source from: <a
href="http://www.python.org/download/">www.python.org/download/</a></p>

<p>The CCP1GUI also relies on the additional Python packages: Numeric
Python, Scientific Python and Python Mega Widgets (PMW).</p>

<a name="linuxnumeric"></a><h5>Numeric Python</h5>
<p>Numeric python is available from: <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy</a></p>

<p>On this page, follow the link to <b>numpy</b> in the <b>Latest
Files Releases</b> section and download a
<b>Numeric-<i>&lt;version_number&gt;</i>.tar.gz</b> file to a folder
on your computer.</p>

<p>To install the package, you will need to be in the directory you 
have just unpacked and have root priviledges. Now enter:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>python setup.py install</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This runs the setup.py  python script that copies the relevant files 
into the
path of the python version you are using to invoke the script.</p>

<a name="linuxscientific"></a><h5>Scientific Python</h5>

<p>Scientific python is available from: <a
href="http://starship.python.net/~hinsen/ScientificPython/">
http://starship.python.net/~hinsen/ScientificPython</a>.</p>

<p>Both rpm and .tar.gz versions are available.To install the tar.gz
version, unzip and untar the archive and then <kbd>cd</kbd> into the 
directory
that is created and enter:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>python setup.py install</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<a name="linuxpmw"></a><h5>Python Megawidgets (Pmw)</h5>
<p>The final step to get the python side of things working is to 
install the Python Mega Widgets package.</p>

<p>This can be downloaded
from:<a href="http://pmw.sourceforge.net/"> http://pmw.sourceforge.net/</a> 
as a gzipped tar archive.</p>

<p>Detailed installation instructions are available at: <a 
href="http://pmw.sourceforge.net/doc/starting.html">http://pmw.sourceforge.net/doc/starting</a>.</p>

<p>To install the package unzip and untar the package. This will
create a directory containing all of the PMW files and  this then
needs to be moved into a place where python will find it. Assuming you
are running python 2.<i>n</i> ( where <i>n</i> is one of 1, 2, 3 or 4
depending on which version of python you are using )  a good place to
put it is: </p>

<b>/usr/lib/python2.<i>n</i>/site-packages/</b>

<p>You can move the directory into this path by becoming root and 
entering:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>mv <i>&lt;PMW_directory&gt;</i> /usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/<i>&lt;PMW_directory&gt;</i></tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<a name="linuxtkinter"></a><h5>Tkinter</h5>
<p>Your Python distribution should come with a valid version of
Tkinter (this may also be called python-tk). This is the python module
that acts as the interface to the Tk toolkit (see below). If you mix
and match your versions of Tcl/Tk and VTK that you may encouter
problems with the version of Tkinter you are using. If this is the
case, an error will be displayed indicating that a particular version
of Tkinter is required when you try and run the CCP1GUI for the first
time. If this is the case, you can search for an appropriate rpm
package at: <a
href="http://www.rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/">www.rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/</a>.
If you are unsure how to query and install rpm packages, please read
the <a href="linuxhelp.html">Linux Help</a> section.</p>

<a name="linuxtcl"></a><h3>Tcl/Tk</h3>
<p>Tcl (Tool Command Language) is an open source scripting language 
that
has a simple and programmable syntax and can be either used as a
standalone application or embedded in application programs. Tk is a
graphical user interface toolkit used to create GUIs.</p>

<p>The latest version of Tcl/Tk is available as source code or with
links to the pre-compiled binaries at:<a
href="http://dev.scriptics.com/software/tcltk/">http://dev.scriptics.com/software/tcltk</a></p>

<p>As ever, rpm distributions can be found at: <a
href="http://www.rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/">www.rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/</a></p>

<h4>VTK</h4>

<p>If you are fortunate then you may find that a vtk package already exists
for your distribution. This is certainly the case for Debian, and if  are running Redhat 9.0, rpm distributions for are available from:<a 
href="http://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/vtk/">www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/vtk/</a></p>

<p>If you are running Redhat 7.1, then vtk rpms for this distribution 
are available from:</p>
<a
href="http://www.fysik.dtu.dk/CAMPOS/Download/CAMPOS_access.html">www.fysik.dtu.dk/CAMPOS/Download/CAMPOS_access.html</a>

<p>The packages you will need to download from this site are:</p>

<ul>
<li>vtk-<i>&lt;release_and_cvs_number&gt;</i>.i386.rpm</li>
<li>vtk-python-<i>&lt;release_and_cvs_number&gt;</i>.i386.rpm</li>
</ul>

<p>If the above fails, then there are instructions on building VTK <a href="#vtk">here</a>,
however, before you read these instructions, you will need to ensure
that you have the developmental pacakges for Tk, Tcl and Python installed. The rpm versions of these
packges are called:</p>
<ul>
<li>python-devel-<i>&lt;version_number&gt;</i></li>
<li>tcl-devel-<i>&lt;version_number&gt;</i></li>
<li>tk-devel-<i>&lt;version_number&gt;</i></li>
</ul>

<p> where <i>&lt;version_number&gt;</i> is a version number compatible
with whatever version of python, tk and tcl you are running.</p>

<hr width="75%"/>

<a name="windows"><h3>Windows</h3></a>
<p>The following steps describe two  ways to get the CCP1GUI up
and running on a Windows XP system. Both methods rely on the now
outdated Python2.1 distribution, as an executable installer for VTK
isn't available yet for the newer versions of Python. The first
section of this documentation therefore explains how to install Python2.1 and
PythonWin on a Windows  XP System. It is possible to get the CCP1GUI to work
with later versions of Python and VTK, although the installation procedure is a little more involved.</p>

<p>If you don't already have it, you will need to download
Winzip. Although windows has its own 'zip' utility it cannot deal with
.tar.gz archives. An evaluation version of Winzip can be downloaded
from <a href="http://www.winzip.com">www.winzip.com</a>.</p>

<h4>Python2.1</h4>
<p>First, download the <b><i>Python-2.1.3.exe</i></b> 
installer from:
<a href="http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.1.3">
www.python.org</a>. The uninstaller for this version of Python has a
bug in it, so it's advisable to also download the
<b><i>UNWISE.exe</i></b> file.</p>

<p>To install the program, just double-click on the
executable icon. You will asked where to install Python and should 
accept
the default option of: <b>C:\Python21</b>. It's also advisable to 
select the
<i>make backups</i> option in case anything goes wrong. Once the 
installer
has finished, over-write the <b><i>UNWISE.exe</i></b> file in the 
<b>C:\Python21</b>
directory with the one you downloaded.</p>

<h5>PythonWin</h5>
<p>The next stage is to download and install PythonWin for Python
2.1. The <b><i>win32all-151.exe</i></b> executable is available from <a
href="http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/win32/Downloads.html">
http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/win32/Downloads.html</a>. Just 
double-click the executable to install it.</p>


<h4>The Visualisation Toolkit (VTK)</h4>
<p>This package provide most of the graphical functionality of the
CCP1GUI. A windows executable that is compatible with Python 2.1 is
available from the <a
href="http://public.kitware.com/VTK/get-software.php">VTK
website</a>.</p>

<p>Go to the <b>Wintel Pre-Compiled Binaries (Windows 9x/NT)</b>
section and download the file
<b><i>vtk42-LatestRelease.exe</i></b>.</p>

<p>To install VTK, just run the <b><i>vtk42-LatestRelease.exe</i></b>
executable, and it will install VTK in <b>C:\Program 
Files\vtk42</b>.</p>

<h4>Display problems with Windows NT</h4>
<p>We have found that on our Windows NT systems it has been necessary 
to 
change the number of colours (choose <b>Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; 
control
panels -&gt; Display</b>)
i.e. 1677216) - with the default the atom picking didn't work 
properly.</p>

<hr width="75%"/>

<a name="macosx"></a><h3>Macintosh OSX</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, the version of Python that ships with OSX (Darwin at
any rate) does not include Tk/Tcl or Tkinter by default (why?!?), so
you will need to install these packages first.</p>

<a name="mactcl"><h4>Tcl/Tk Aqua</h4>
<p>Tcl/Tk for MacOSX can be downloaded from <a
href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/unix_open_source/tcltkaqua.html">Apple</a>
- just follow the instructions for installing them.</p>

<h4> Tkinter ( Numeric Python and IDLE )</h4>
<p>The next step is to install the Mac Python add-ons, which include a
Package Manager tool that you can use to install Tkinter ( as well as Numeric
Python and IDLE ). You can get the Package Manger 
 from <a
href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~jack/macpython/download.html">MacPython
website</a>. Once you have installed this, it will create a folder
call <b><tt>MacPython-<i>version</i></b></tt> ( where version is the
version of Python you are using  - e.g. 2.3 ) in your Applications
folder. Use the Finder to navigate to this folder and then run
<tt>PackageManager</tt> program.</p>

<small><blockquote><b>NB:</b> If this crashes on opening with a
message about being unable to open a &quot;.plist&quot; file, then the
Package Manager is looking at the wrong online database to get it's
list of available packages. To find out about current databases, visit the
<a href="http://www.python.org/packman/">packman</a> webpage and get
the url for a suitable database. Then in PackageManager, select
<b>File -&gt; Open Url...</b> and paste in the
url.</small></blockquote>

<p>In the package manager then select the following packages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Numeric-<i>version</i>-binary</li>
<li>_tkinter-<i>version</i>-binary</li>
<li>IDLE-<i>version</i>-binary</li>
</ul>

<p>( where version will be a differnent number depending on the
version ) and then click the <b>install</b> button at the bottom of
the page to install the packages.</p>

<p>If the above commands work for you, you should now be in a position
to download one of the pre-packaged distributions or Mac OSX as
described in the <a href="#easyinstall">Easy Installation
Instructions</a> above. Alternatively, you can install the
remaining dependencies as described below:</p>

<h4>Scientific Python and Pmw</h4>
<p> The instructions for installing <a href="#linuxscientific">Scientific
Python</a> and <a href="#linuxpmw">Pmw</a> under Unix/Linux are also
applicable under Mac OSX, so please read the information in those
sections.</p>

<h4>VTK</h4>
<p>If you have installed Tk/Tcl and Tkinter as described above, then
follow the instructions <a href="#vtk">below</a> to build vtk.</p>

<hr width="75%"/>

<a name="vtk"></a><h3>Building VTK from source</h3>

<p>The Visualization ToolKit (VTK) is an open source, freely available
software system for 3D computer graphics, image processing, and
visualization that can be used or creating graphical representations
of molecules.</p>

<p> The following instructions are for building VTK from
source. To do this you will need  a C/C++-compiler. On Linux systems gcc will be there by
default, on Macs, you can install <a
href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">fink</a> and use this to install
gcc. On Windows, your best bet is probably to install <a
href="http://www.cygwin.com/">cygwin</a> and get gcc that way.</p>

<p>With a compiler in place you will need to install 
the relevant development packages on your system ( development
packages contain the header files for C/C++ and other information
needed when you compile a package ). Assume you already have Tk/Tcl,
Python and Tkinter installed as mentioned in the sections above, then you will just need to
install the development versions of these packges.</p>

<p>The next stage is to install cmake, the cross-platform make
utility. You can get this from the <a
href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake website</a>.</p>

<p>Next, download the lastest VTK release
from <a href="http://public.kitware.com/VTK/get-software.php">http://public.kitware.com/VTK/get-software.php</a>.
The file will extract to a directory called VTK. <kbd>cd</kbd> into
this directory and enter:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>cmake -i</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This runs CMake in interactive mode, where it will ask you a
number of different questions. The first question you will be asked is
if you would like to see the advanced options - if you do you probably
don't need to be reading this. Most of the remaining options shouldn't need to
be changed and those that you may want to should be
self-explanatory. Options that you <i>must</i> select (i.e. set to <i>ON</i>), however are the
following:</p>

<ul>
<li>BUILD_SHARED_LIBS</li>
<li>VTK_USE_HYBRID</li>
<li>VTK_WRAP_PYTHON</li>
<li>VTK_WRAP_TCL</li>
</ul>

<p>When CMake has finished, just type:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>make</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>in the VTK directory to build the VTK binaries, and then:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>make install</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

</p>To install vtk onto your system.</p>
