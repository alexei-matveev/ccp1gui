<h1 align=center>The CCP1 Graphical User Interface</h1>

<p>The Graphical User Interface (GUI) for CCP1 is built using a number 
of different technologies. The 'interface', including things like
the menus and buttons, are implemented using the Tcl/Tk and PMW
toolkits. The drawing of molecules on the screen is carried out by the
Visualisation Toolkit (VTK) using the OpenGl graphics standard. The
'glue' that links all of these technologies together to  present
a single coherent interface is the Python programming language.</p>

<p>Python, Tcl/Tk, VTK and OpenGL are available for almost every
flavour of <a href="#linux">Linux</a>, Macintosh or <a
href="#windows">Windows</a>, so CCP1 can be made to run on any of
these systems. The following sections describe the steps you will need
to take to install the packages needed to get the CCP1GUI running on
your system.</p>


<a name="linux"><h2 align=center>Linux</h2></a>
<p>There are two ways to get the CCP1GUI up and running on your
system. The first is the easiest and least-involved, although it will
require that you have a reasonably fast internet connection as the
file to be downloaded is about 20MB in size. The
second is more involved and should only be followed if you know what
software you have installed on your system and are happy installing
new packages.</p>

<h3>Easy Installation</h3>
<p>Most modern Linux distributions ship with Python, Tk/Tcl and
Tkinter (aka python-tk) already installed. If you are missing any of these packages, the <a
href="#linuxpython">Python</a>, <a href="#linuxtcl">Tcl</a> and <a
href="#linuxtkinter">Tkinter</a> sections below will guide you through
their installation and the <a href="linuxhelp.html">Linux Help</a>
section, provides general help on the ins and outs of installing
software under Linux.</p>

<p>With Python and Tcl installed, all you need to do is download the
<kbd>ccp1gui-<i>&lt;version&gt;</i>.tar.gz</kbd> file suitable for your
Linux distribution. The files are available via ftp from
<a
href=ftp://ftp.dl.ac.uk/qcg/ccp1gui>ftp://ftp.dl.ac.uk/qcg/ccp1gui</a>
- just follow the link to your distribution. Currently we have
packaged distributions for <a
href="ftp://ftp.dl.ac.uk/qcg/ccp1gui/redhat9.0">Redhat 9.0</a> and <a
href="ftp://ftp.dl.ac.uk/qcg/ccp1gui/suse9.0">Suse 9.0</a>.

<p>Place the file in a directory somewhere on your hard drive and
unpackage it with the command:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>tar -xvzf ccp1gui-<i>&lt;version&gt;</i>.tar.gz</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>where <i>&lt;version&gt;</i> is a number indicating the release of the
CCP1GUI with <kbd>rh9</kbd> appended to it for Redhat9.0 and <kbd>suse9</kbd> for Suse
9.0.</p>

<a name="directory"></a><p>The file will un-tar into a directory called <b>ccp1gui</b>. The
directory has the following structure:<p>
<pre>

           |--data/
ccp1gui/---|--ccp1gui.bash
           |--ccp1gui.bat
           |--VTK/
           |--Numeric/
           |--Numeric.pth
           |--Scientific/
           |--Pmw
           |
           |              |-- basis/
           |              |-- ccp1gui/
           |--python_dev/-|-- ccp1gui.bat
                          |-- ccp1gui.sh
                          |-- chempy
                          |-- examples/
                          |-- graph/
                          |-- jobmanager/
                          |-- pymolgraph/
                          |-- README
                          |-- tests
                          |-- tkmolview
                          |-- doc/------|--html/

</pre>

To run the CCP1GUI, just <kbd>cd</kbd> into this directory and run the
ccp1gui.bash script with the command:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>./ccp1gui.bash</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h4>Upgrading</h4>
<p>If you would like to upgrade your version of the CCP1GUI, if you hear
of any new bug fixes or additional features, you will need to download
a new <b>python_dev</b> directory to replace your current version. </p>

<p>The latest version of this directory is always available on our
<a href="ftp://ftp.dl.ac.uk/qcg/ccp1gui/">ftp site</a>. Download the
file ccp1gui-<i>&lt;latest_release&gt;</i>.tar.gz into your <b>ccp1gui</b> directory, and unpack it with the command:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>tar-xvzf ccp1gui-<i>&lt;latest_release&gt;</i>.tar.gz</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>where <i>&lt;latest_release&gt;</i> is the release version you have
downloaded. This will unpack to create a new python_dev directory. You
should then be able to run the CCP1GUI using the ccp1gui.bash script in the <b>ccp1gui</b> directory as before.</p>

<p>If you have any problems installing or running the CCP1GUI using this method, please <a
href="mailto:j.m.h.thomas@dl.ac.uk">let us know</a>.

<hr width=75%>
<h3>Full Installation</h3>
<p>This section describes the seperate instalation steps for all of
the individual pieces of software that are used by the CCP1GUI. If you are
unfamiliar with the basics of how to install software distributed as
rpm files or zipped and compressed archives, there are brief notes in
the <a href="linuxhelp.html">Linux Help</a> section.</p>

<p>These are only general instructions that were correct at the
time of writing. Software being what it is however, they are likely to
become out of date fairly quickly. In all cases however, there should
be up-to-date instructions on how to install the packages on their
websites or included as README files in any downloads. The
notes here should only be taken as a guide and you are strongly
advised to read the documentation supplied with the packages to
determine the best way to install them.</p>

<a name="linuxpython"></a><h3>Python</h3>
<p>There are currently three different python distributions in use:
python 1.5, 2.2 and 2.3. Of these, python 2.2 is the most common.</p>

<p>If you have more than one python distribution installed (as may well
be the case if you are running Redhat) you will need to ensure that
you invoke the correct version whenever you install a python-related 
package. A
particular version of python will install any new packages within its
own paths which may not be accessible to other distributions.</p>

<p>To find out what executable you are calling when you type python, 
enter:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>which python</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This will show  the path to the executable you are calling on when
you type <kbd>python</kbd>. List the contents of that directory to see
if you have more than one version of python there (e.g. /usr/bin/python and
/usr/bin/python2). If you do, you will need to decide which
version to use (python 2.2 is recommended) and stick with it - in the
above case by typing <kbd>python2</kbd> whenever you invoke python.</p>

<p>Python is available as source from:<a
href="http://www.python.org/download/">www.python.org/download/</a>.</p>

<p>You can search for an appropriate rpm package at: <a
href="http://www.rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/">www.rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/</a>
.</p>

<p>The CCP1GUI also relies on the additional Python packages: Numeric
Python, Scientific Python and Python Mega Widgets (PMW). These
packages are not usually installed as rpms and are not part of the
standard python distribution, so are unlikely to have been installed
on your system.</p>

<h4>Numeric Python</h4>
<p>Numeric python is available from: <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy</a>.</p>

<p>On this page, follow the link to <b>numpy</b> in the <b>Latest
Files Releases</b> section and download a
<b>Numeric-<i>&lt;version_number&gt;</i>.tar.gz</b> file to a folder
on your computer.</p>

<p>To install the package, you will need to be in the directory you 
have
just unpacked and have root priviledges. Now enter:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>python setup.py install</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This runs the setup.py  python script that copies the relevant files 
into the
path of the python version you are using to invoke the script.</p>

<h4>Scientific Python</h4>

<p>Scientific python is available from: <a
href="http://starship.python.net/~hinsen/ScientificPython/">
http://starship.python.net/~hinsen/ScientificPython</a>.</p>

<p>Both rpm and .tar.gz versions are available.To install the tar.gz
version, unzip and untar the archive and then <kbd>cd</kbd> into the 
directory
that is created and enter:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>python setup.py build</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This will build the relevant files which will then need to be
installed. Installing the files will probably need root permission, so
su to root and then enter:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>python setup.py install</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Python Megawidgets (Pmw)</h4>
<p>The final step to get the python side of things working is to 
install
the Python Mega Widgets package.</p>

<p>This can be downloaded
from:<a href="http://pmw.sourceforge.net/"> http://pmw.sourceforge.net/</a> 
as
a gzipped tar archive.</p>

<p>Detailed installation instructions are available at: <a 
href="http://pmw.sourceforge.net/doc/starting.html">http://pmw.sourceforge.net/doc/starting</a>.</p>

<p>To install the package unzip and untar the package. This will create 
a
directory containing all of the PMW files and  this then needs to be
moved into a place where python will find it. Assuming you are
running python 2.2 a good place to put it is: </p>

<b>/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/</b>

<p>You can move the directory into this path by becoming root and 
entering:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>mv <i>&lt;PMW_directory&gt;</i> /usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/<i>&lt;PMW_directory&gt;</i></tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>If you can't get root priviledges, or you don't want to move the
directory, it is also possible put the path for the PMW directory in
your <b>PYTHONPATH</b> variable. The <b>PYTHONPATH</b> variables tells 
python where
to look for the files it needs. To append the Pmw directory to your
existing <b>PYTHONPATH</b> enter:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<i>&lt;Pmw_directory&gt;</i>
</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Where <i>&lt;Pmw_directory&gt;</i> is the full path to the Pmw 
directory.</p>

<a name="linuxtkinter"></a><h4>Tkinter</h4>
<p>Your Python distribution should come with a valid version of
Tkinter (this may also be called python-tk). This is the python module
that acts as the interface to the Tk toolkit (see below). If you mix
and match your versions of Tcl/Tk and VTK that you may encouter
problems with the version of Tkinter you are using. If this is the
case, an error will be displayed indicating that a particular version
of Tkinter is required when you try and run the CCP1GUI for the first
time. If this is the case, you can search for an appropriate rpm
package at: <a
href="http://www.rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/">www.rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/</a>.
If you are unsure how to query and install rpm packages, please read
the <a href="linuxhelp.html">Linux Help</a> section.</p>

<a name="#linuxtcl"></a><h3>Tcl/Tk</h3>
<p>Tcl (Tool Command Language) is an open source scripting language 
that
has a simple and programmable syntax and can be either used as a
standalone application or embedded in application programs. Tk is a
graphical user interface toolkit used to create GUIs.</p>

<p>The latest version of Tcl/Tk is available as source code or with
links to the pre-compiled binaries at:<a
href="http://dev.scriptics.com/software/tcltk/">http://dev.scriptics.com/software/tcltk</a></p>

<p>As ever, rpm distributions can be found at: <a
href="http://www.rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/">www.rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/</a></p>

<h3>VTK</h3>
<p>The Visualization ToolKit (VTK) is an open source, freely available
software system for 3D computer graphics, image processing, and
visualization that can be used or creating graphical representations
of molecules.</p>

<p>VTK can be installed from source, or there are rpm distributions
available for Redhat9.0 and Redhat7.3 (see <a href="#vtkrpmrh">below</a>).</p>

<p>If you decide to install VTK from source, you will firstly need to download
the <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a> cross-platform make
utility.</p>

<p>You will also need to ensure that you have all of the developmental
software for Tk, Tcl and Python installed. The rpm versions of these
packges are called:</p>
<ul>
<li>python-devel-<i>&lt;version_number&gt;</i></li>
<li>tcl-devel-<i>&lt;version_number&gt;</i></li>
<li>tk-devel-<i>&lt;version_number&gt;</i></li>
</ul>

<p> where <i>&lt;version_number&gt;</i> is a version number compatible
with whatever version of python, tk and tcl you are running.</p>


<p>With these packages installed, download the lastest VTK release
from <a
href="http://public.kitware.com/VTK/get-software.php">http://public.kitware.com/VTK/get-software.php</a>.
The file will extract to a directory called VTK. <kbd>cd</kbd> into
this directory and enter:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>cmake -i</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This runs CMake in interactive mode, where it will ask you a
number of different questions. The first question you will be asked is
if you would like to see the advanced options - if you do you probably
don't need to be reading this. Most of the remaining options shouldn't need to
be changed and those that you may want to should be
self-explanatory. Options that you <i>must</i> select (i.e. set to <i>ON</i>), however are the
following:</p>

<ul>
<li>BUILD_SHARED_LIBS</li>
<li>VTK_USE_HYBRID</li>
<li>VTK_WRAP_PYTHON</li>
<li>VTK_WRAP_TCL</li>
</ul>

<p>When CMake has finished, just type:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>make</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>in the VTK directory to build the VTK binaries, and then:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>make install</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

</p>if you wish to install the files.</p>

<a name="vtkrpmrh"></a><h4>VTK rpm's</h4>

<p>If all of the above sounds a little
involved and you are running Redhat 9.0, more manageable rpm distributions for are available from:<a 
href="http://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/vtk/">www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/vtk/</a></p>

<p>If you are running Redhat 7.1, then vtk rpms for this distribution 
areavailable from:</p>

<a
href="http://www.fysik.dtu.dk/CAMPOS/Download/CAMPOS_access.html">www.fysik.dtu.dk/CAMPOS/Download/CAMPOS_access.html</a>

<p>The packages you will need to download from this site are:</p>

<ul>
<li>vtk-<i>&lt;release_and_cvs_number&gt;</i>.i386.rpm</li>
<li>vtk-python-<i>&lt;release_and_cvs_number&gt;</i>.i386.rpm</li>
</ul>

<h3>Getting the CCP1GUI to work</h3>
<p>Once you have prepared your system by installing the above
packages, you are ready to download and run the CCP1GUI. Download the
latest version of the CCP1GUI from our ftp site at <a
href=ftp://ftp.dl.ac.uk/qcg/ccp1gui/>ftp://ftp.dl.ac.uk/qcg/ccp1gui/ccp1gui-<i>&lt;latest_release&gt;</i>.tar.gz</a>
and extract the archive to a directory called <b>python_dev</b> on
your hard drive.

Before you run the CCP1GUI you will need to add the path to the  
<b>python_dev</b>
directory to your <b><i>PYTHONPATH</i></b> variable. To do this 
enter:</p>


<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<i>&lt;directory_prefix&gt;</i>/python_dev</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>where <i>directory_prefix</i> is the full path to the
<b>python_dev</b> directory. To get the CCP1GUI to run, you need to run
python on the vtkgraph.py file in the <b>python_dev/tkmolview</b>
directory. To do this enter:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<tt>python <i>&lt;directory_prefix&gt;</i>/python_dev/tkmolview/vtkgraph.py</tt>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p><i>NB. This assumes that the <kbd>python</kbd> runs the correct
version of python as was mentioned in the <a
href="#linuxpython">python</a> section.</i></p>

<hr>

<a name="windows"><h2 align=center>Windows</h2></a>
<p>The following steps describe two  ways to get the CCP1GUI up
and running on a Windows XP system. Both methods rely on the now
outdated Python2.1 distribution, as an executable installer for VTK
isn't available yet for the newer versions of Python. The first
section of this documentation therefore explains how to install Python2.1 and
PythonWin on a Windows  XP System. It is possible to get the CCP1GUI to work
with later versions of Python and VTK, although the installation procedure is a little more involved.</p>

<p>If you don't already have it, you will need to download
Winzip. Although windows has its own 'zip' utility it cannot deal with
.tar.gz archives. An evaluation version of Winzip can be downloaded
from <a href="http://www.winzip.com">www.winzip.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Python2.1</h3>
<p>First, download the <b><i>Python-2.1.3.exe</i></b> 
installer from:
<a href="http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.1.3">
www.python.org</a>. The uninstaller for this version of Python has a
bug in it, so it's advisable to also download the
<b><i>UNWISE.exe</i></b> file.</p>

<p>To install the program, just double-click on the
executable icon. You will asked where to install Python and should 
accept
the default option of: <b>C:\Python21</b>. It's also advisable to 
select the
<i>make backups</i> option in case anything goes wrong. Once the 
installer
has finished, over-write the <b><i>UNWISE.exe</i></b> file in the 
<b>C:\Python21</b>
directory with the one you downloaded.</p>

<h4>PythonWin</h4>
<p>The next stage is to download and install PythonWin for Python
2.1. The <b><i>win32all-151.exe</i></b> executable is available from <a
href="http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/win32/Downloads.html">
http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/win32/Downloads.html</a>. Just 
double-click the executable to install it.</p>

<h3>Easy Installation of the CCP1GUI</h3>
<p>There is a version of the GUI available for FTP download, that
packages all of the files required to run the CCP1GUI into a single
directory. The  directory structure is the same as that for the Linux
distribution shown <a href="#directory">above</a>. The only additional
requirements for this version are Python 2.1 and PythonWin.</p>

<p>Once you have these installed, download the file
<kbd>ccp1gui-<i>&lt;version&gt;</i>_win.tar.gz</kbd> file from our <a
href="ftp://ftp.dl.ac.uk/qcg/ccp1gui/windows">ftp site</a> and
uncompress the package using WinZip. The package will decompress to
give a directory called <b>ccpigui</b>. To run the CCP1GUI,
open the ccp1gui directory and double-click on the <b>ccp1gui.bat</b>
batch file. If you experience problems with this, please read the <a
href="#batchprobs">problems</a> section.</p>

<h3>PieceWise Installation</h3>
<p>If you are not using the packaged tar file, you will need to
download and install VTK and then download the CCP1GUI files as
described below:</p>

<h4>The Visualisation Toolkit (VTK)</h4>
<p>This package provide most of the graphical functionality of the
CCP1GUI. A windows executable that is compatible with Python 2.1 is
available from the <a
href="http://public.kitware.com/VTK/get-software.php">VTK
website</a>.</p>

<p>Go to the <b>Wintel Pre-Compiled Binaries (Windows 9x/NT)</b>
section and download the file
<b><i>vtk42-LatestRelease.exe</i></b>.</p>

<p>To install VTK, just run the <b><i>vtk42-LatestRelease.exe</i></b>
executable, and it will install VTK in <b>C:\Program 
Files\vtk42</b>.</p>

<h4>The CCP1GUI directory</h4>
<p>This directory is available from our <a
href="ftp://ftp.dl.ac.uk/qcg/CCP1GUI">ftp site </a> as a zipped 
and tarred archive. Download the <b>ccp1gui-<i>&lt;version&gt;</i>.tar.gz</b>
file. Use WinZip to extract the archive. which will decompress to give
a directory called <b>python_dev</b>. Before you run the GUI, using
this method you will need to set your PYTHONPATH environment variable
as described <a href="#winpythonpath">below</a>. With this done, you
can run the CCP1GUI by opening the <b>python_dev</b> directory and
double-clicking on the <b>ccp1gui.bat</b> batch file.</p>

<a name="batchprobs"></a><h3 align=center>If it doesn't work</h3>
<p>If for some reason the GUI doesn't run when you click on the batch
file, the most likely reason is that it cannot find all of the files
it needs to run. The following section describes how the batch file
sets up the 'environment' that the CCP1GUI runs in, so that you can
see if this is correct for your system and change it if it isn't.</p>

<p>The batch file is displayed below (the purple line numbers are just
there to aid explanation and don't appear in the file proper):</p>

<p>In a batch file, the argument <font color=ff0000>%0\</font> refers
to the batch file itself, so the first two lines ensure that the
CCP1GUI is run from the main installation directory. Line 3 then sets
the variable <b>ROOTDIR</b> to signify this directory (this is done so
that all other directory paths are relative to this directory, so you
can install the CCP1GUI whereever you wish).<p>

<p>Line 4 appends the directory containing the VTK library files to
the <b>PATH</b> environment variable . If you have installed your VTK
library files elseswhere, you will need to change this.<p>

<p>Lines 5 to 9 build up the <b>PYTHONPATH</b> environment variable,
which tells python where to find the files it needs. If you have
installed VTK or Numeric or any of the other modules somewhere else
you will need to change the lines accordingly.</p>

<p>Line 10 runs the CCP1GUI using Python version 2.1, which it expects
to find installed in the folder <b>C:\Python21</b> If you have
installed Python2.1 elsewhere, then change this line.</p>

<p>Alternatively, to run the CCP1GUI using Pythonwin, open Pythonwin 
(<b>Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Python2.1 -&gt; Pythonwin</b>) and go to 
<b>File -&gt; Run...</b>. Click on the <b><i>Browse</i></b> button and 
select the <b><i>vtkgraph</i></b> in the <b>python_dev/tkmolview</b>
directory and click <b><i>Open</i></b> and then click on
<b><i>Ok</i></b>. For this to work, you will have to have set your
<b><i>PYTHONPATH</i></b> variable accordingly.</p>

<h4>Display problems with Windows NT</h4>
<p>We have found that on our Windows NT systems it has been necessary 
to 
change the number of colours (choose <b>Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; 
control
panels -&gt; Display</b>)
i.e. 1677216) - with the default the atom picking didn't work 
properly.</p>

<a name="winpythonpath"></a><h4>Setting the PYTHONPATH environment 
variable.</h4>
<p>To set the <b><i>PYTHONPATH</i></b> variable go to <b>Control Panel 
-&gt;
System-&gt; Advanced</b> and click the <b>'Environment
Variables'</b> button. In the <b>'System Variables'</b> panel that
appears, <i>click</i> <b>New</b> and enter <kbd>PYTHONPATH</kbd> in the
<b>'Variable Name'</b> field. In the <b>'Variable Value'</b> field 
enter
the string corresponding to the path of the directories you wish to 
include in your <b><i>PYTHONPATH</i></b>. For the CCP1GUI this should include 
the following paths:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>&lt;python_prefix&gt;</i>\python_dev</b></li>
<li><b><i>&lt;vtk_prefix&gt;</i>\vtk42\Wrapping\Python</b></li>
<li><b><i>&lt;vtk_prefix&gt;</i>\vtk42\bin</b></li>
</ul>

<p>where <b><i>&lt;python_prefix&gt;</i></b> is the path to your 
<b>python_dev</b> directory, and <b><i>&lt;vtk_prefix&gt;</i></b>, the path 
to wherever you have installed vtk.</p>

<p>If your operating system is installed on your <b>C:</b> drive and
you have put all the programs in their default locations, your
<b><i>PYTHONPATH</i></b> will be the following:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
