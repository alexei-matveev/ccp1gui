The Edit Coordinates Window
===========================

This can be used to manually edit the coordinates of the atoms in a
molecule using either internal (displayed as a Z-matrix) or Cartesian
coordinates. It is also possible to mix and match the two.

The coordinates window at the top of the Edit Window is a table displaying
the coordinates. Each row corresponds to an individual atom. The table
below shows the meaning of each of the columns in this panel for
Z-matrix format and Cartesian coordinates.


Title	    Cartesian					Zmatrix
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
i	    A number serving as a unique		Same as for Cartiesians.
	    identifier for the atom

Sym	    The chemical Symbol for the atom		Same as for Cartesians.
	    - a number may be appended to this
	    to help identify the atom.


i1	    Unused	     				The first atom to which
							this atom is connected.


x/r	    The x-coordinate of the atom in		The distance of this
	    Angstroms.	     	   			atom from the atom 
							specified in i1.

i2          Unused					The second atom to which
	    						this atom is connected.

y/theta	    The y-coordinate of the atom in		The angle between this atom
            Angstroms.	     				and the atoms identified
							in columns i1 and i2.

i3          Unused					The third atom to which
	    						this atom is connected.

z/phi       The z-coordinate of the atom in		The dihedral angle between
            Angstroms.	     				this atom and those idenfified
							in the fields i1, i2 and i3.

connections The other atoms to which this atom		Unused.
	    this atom is connected.


Input Line
----------
Values in the coordinates window cannot be edited by directly. However, by
clicking on the row corresponding to an atom in the coordinates window (or
clicking on the atom in the main window), the values for that atom
appear in the Input Line fields headed "Enter Coordinate values" that
sits below the table. By clicking in a field, the value can then be
edited.

Variables
---------
The Variables field shows any values that are specified as variable
within the coordinates window. 

Error Output
------------
If there is a problem with any of the coordinates that have been
entered, an error message will be displayed here.

File Menu
=========

Save Zmatrix
------------
Save the coordinates to a simple text file with the extension .zmt

Load Zmatrix
------------
Load coordinates from a file.

Reload from Graphics Window
---------------------------
Update the coordinates window with the coordinates from the molecule
displayed in the main window.


Edit Menu
=========

Select All Atoms
----------------
This selects and highlights all of the atoms specified in the
coordinates window  - the corresponding atoms in the main window will
also be highlighted.

Insert Atoms
-----------
This opens up a blank Input Line so that the coordinates for a new
atom can be added.

Copy Atoms
---------
The values for the specified atoms will be copied into a buffer ready
for pasting.

Cut Atoms
--------
The atoms will be removed from the coordiantes window, but the values
will be copied into a buffer ready to be pasted.

Paste Atoms
----------
Paste the coordinates of any atoms that were saved into the buffer into
the table.

Delete Atoms
------------
Delete the selected atoms, but don't save their values.

r,x -> var
----------
Specify the value for x-coordinate or r as a variable (this value will then
be displayed in the 'Variables' window).

theta,y -> var
----------
Specify the value for y-coordinate or theta as a variable (this value will then
be displayed in the 'Variables' window).

phi,z -> var
----------
Specify the value for z-coordinate or phi as a variable (this value will then
be displayed in the 'Variables' window).

all -> var
----------
Specify that all the selected values should be variables.

Select All Variables
--------------------
This selects all of the variables displayed in the 'Variables' window.

Delete Variables
----------------
Remove a variables from the zmatrix.


Convert Menu
============

AutoZ
-----
Generate an automatic (new) zmatrix
BUG!!! This requires all atoms to be connected into a single molecule

Convert Selection to Z-Matrix/ Convert Selection to Cartesian
--------------------------------------------------------------
Interchanges the type of definition for selected atoms.
When switching to z-matrix the program will use any internal coordinates
that have been defined, if not, i1,i2,i3,r,theta,phi fields will all have
default values and will need to be filled in.
BUG!!! Don't try and convert the first 3 atoms to zmatrix form, as this
will require a reorientation/translation of the molecule which is not 
performed.


Calculate
=========

Auto Recalc
-----------
This toggles whether the coordinates should be recalculated as each change
is made or whether the calculation should wait until 'Recompute Now'
is selected.

Recompute Now
-------------
Recompute the Z-matrix. Only needed if you switch Auto recalc off.
