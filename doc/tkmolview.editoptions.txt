Connectivity

      + Connection Parameters
       
        The parameters here determine how the gui decides if two atoms are
        bonded (assuming that the connectivity has not been specified in the
        input file). The formula that is used to determine bonding is:
       
                  r[ij] < scale * (r[cov](i) + r[cov](j)) + tolerance          
       
        where r[ij] is the distance between the two atomic centres, r[cov](n)
        the Van der Waals radius of the atom, scale the radius scale factor and
        tolerance the tolerance.
       
          o Radius scale - this determines the radius scale in the above
            formula.
          o Tolerance - this determines the tolerance in the above
            formula.

      + Non-bonded Connection Parameters
       
        The parameters here determine how the gui decides if two non-bonded,
        but adjacent atoms, are in contact with each other. This determined
        using the same formula as for bondeded atoms and the same parameters
        are adjustable.
       
Visualisation

    Background Colour
   
      + Clicking on the 'Choose' button will open up a window allowing you to
        choose the background colour for the 'canvas' on which the molecules
        are displayed.
      + You can either use the sliders to select the levels of Red, Green and
        Blue components, or type in a hexadecimal value for the colour in the
        'Selection:' box.
   
    Pick Tolerance
   
      + The Pick Tolerance tool allows you to change how close you have to
        place the mouse pointer to an object in order to be able to select that
        object.
