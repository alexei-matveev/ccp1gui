View Menu
=========
It is possible to view the same molecule in a variety of different
ways. The Gui does this by creating different 'view objects', which
are different graphical representations of the same molecule.

View objects are grouped together under the View Menu according to the
molecule to which they belong. Selecting a particular molecule from
the View Menu opens a drop-down menu that lists the available views
for that molecule and the operations that can be carried out on that
view. The operations are:

Show/Hide Molecule View
------------------
This is used to show or hide a particular view of a molecule.

Adjust Molecule View
--------------------
This is where the properties of a particular view can be changed. For
information on the 'Adjust Molecule View' window that appears when
this option is selected, press F1 when the window is displayed.

New Molecule View
-----------------
This creates a new view object for the molecule. The view can then be
adjusted by selecting the view from the menu and selecting 'Adjust
Molecule View' as above.


Viewing the results of calculations
===================================
When a calculation is carried out on a molecule, the result is often
the value of a certain molecular property (the electrostatic
potential or value of the wavefunction for the HOMO, for example) at a
particular point in space.  This property can be represented by a grid
of points, the associated value of each point being proportional to the
magnitude of the property at that point.

The GUI has a number of visualisers that can be used to view such a
grid in a number of different ways.

Irregular View
--------------
This is the closest view to the 'raw' data and consists of a grid of
points with their associated values. The size of the points can also
be altered as can their opacity and the colour mapping.

Density View
------------
This defines a single isosurface for a specified positive value of the
grid. The contour height (which defines the positive value to which
the surface is mapped) is adjustable, as is its colour and opacity.

Orbital View
------------
This is similar to density view, except that a pair of isosurfaces are
drawn, one for a specified positive value and another for a specified
negative value. 

Coloured Isosurface
-------------------
The coloured isosurface representation creates an isosurface at a
specified contour height. This surface can then be coloured according
to the value of one of the other properties at points on this surface.

Cut Slice View
--------------
The cut slice view creates a 2-dimensional 'canvas' that can be
moved through the molecule, with the values of the function at the
point the slice is taken displayed on the canvas as contours or a
colourmap.

The size, orientation and position of the slice may be specified, as
well as the colour and contour properties.

An optional 2D-representation of the canvas can also be
created. Selecting this option opens up a separate window displaying a
front-view of the canvas, which can be saved to the current directory
as the file 'out2d.jpeg'.



Show/Hide All
--------------------
Show All and Hide All affect the visibility of all graphical
representations.

Centre on Selected
-------------------
Changes the origin for viewing and rotations of the centroid
of the selected atoms.
