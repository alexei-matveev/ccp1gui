                             The Editing Tools Window                          
   
    Changing the element type
   
      + When it is first displayed, the upper half of the panel displays a
        selection of elements from the periodic table. To change the element
        type of an atom in the main window, select the atom with the mouse (so
        that a yellow square appears over it) and then click on the button
        representing the element type you would like the atom to be changed to.
      + If the element you are after isn't displayed in the selection, click on
        the 'More...' button to display a full periodic table. To shrink the
        window back down so that it only displays a small selection of
        elements, click on the 'Short Table' button.
   
   
    Deleting atoms or bonds and deleting bonds
   
      + To delete an atom, just select it with the mouse and click on the "Del
        Atom" button.
      + To delete a bond, select the atoms on either side of the bond and click
        on the "Del Bond" button.
      + To add a bond connecting two atoms, select the two atoms you wish to
        connect and click the "Add Bond" button.
   
    Converting generic atoms to Hydrogen Atoms
   
      + When a new molecule is created (using File -> 'New Molecule') or new
        atoms are added to the molecule (as described below) the atoms at the
        end of the bonds are not assigned to any element type. To convert them
        to hydrogen atoms, click the 'All X->H' button.
   
    Adding atoms and bonds to a molecule
   
      + To add bonds to an atom of a molecule, you need to change the
        hybridisation of the atom allow extra bonds to be added. To do this,
        select the atom and then click on a hybridisation scheme from the
        'Hybridisation' section of the Tool Panel.
      + The available options are:
       
          o sp   =  sp
          o sp2  =  sp2
          o sp3  =  sp3
          o tpy  =  trigonal pyrimidal
          o sqpl =  square planar
          o sqpy =  square pyramidal
          o oct  =  octahedral

      + Changing the hybridisation will add however many generic atoms your
        hybridisation scheme permits. You may then change their type
        individually or convert them all to hydrogens as described above.
   
    Adding molecular fragments to a molecule
   
      + To speed up the construction of large molecules, the GUI supports the
        ability to add molecular fragments to a given atom. This is controlled
        through the Add Fragment part to the bottom right of the Tool Panel. To
        add a molecular fragment, select the atom to which you would like to
        add the fragment in the main window, select the desired fragment from
        menu on the right hand side of the Add Fragment frame and then click 
        Add. Supported molecular fragments are:
          o Me   =   Methyl
          o Pr  =  
          o t-Bu  =   tertiary Butyl
          o CO  =   Carbon Monoxide
          o Bu =  
          o eta Bz =  
          o eta Cp  =  
          o i-Bu  =  
          o eta Ethylene  =  
          o i-Pr  =  
          o Et  =   Ethyl
          o Py  =
