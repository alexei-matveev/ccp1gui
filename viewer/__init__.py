"""The TkMolView molecular viewer and editor

TkMolView is a python program to display and edit molecular structures
and data computed from them. It was developed so that the CCP1 GUI
project could used independently of any other packages. Visualisation
is provided by VTK, and to a limited extent by OpenGL.

The project is open source.
